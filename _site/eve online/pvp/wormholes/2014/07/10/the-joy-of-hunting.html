    <p>Since moving to wormhole life, a lot has happened.  A big part of what I do now is logistics, planning, and helping run the day to day corp stuff as I have joined the leadership of my new corporation.  Just to prove I still actually play Eve, I will recount my second completely solo kill.</p>

<p>I logged in, not sure of what I was going to do.  Check on the POS?  Run my PI?  Oh, wait, there is an Imicus on d-scan.  I hop into my Loki (overkill, to be sure), and start looking for my prey.  I assume he has no cloak, as I see probes in space and he is still on d-scan.  I narrow him down to a particular planet, and warp over.</p>

<p>My approach was good, but he was just outside of point range, and moving.  Moving in a direction that gave no good warp in, as it was towards the edge of the system.  I really need to make perches around each planet.  I start flying in the opposite direction, and the phone rings.  I have to help carry up groceries!  This is ok, though, as I can burn away for a minute or two, and use the distance to warp on him.</p>

<p>One sprint of the stairs later, I am 250km from my prey, still on grid.  But I still cannot warp.  If this guy is any good at scanning, he should resolve the few sigs easily.  Time to go all in.  I warp off to a safe, launch combat probes, nail him on the first shot, and make a beeline back.  I’m 20km off, a bit more than I would like, but I drop cloak and burn.  He doesn’t seem to notice.  My autocannons are blazing, and as I sail into range I get my scram engaged.  A few moments later I am rewarded with a nice explosion.  He is paying attention now, and the pod gets away.</p>

<p>My victim is a good sport.  We chat about his fit, which I noticed has no cloak, and instruct that wormholes and cloaks are like peanut butter and jelly.  He relates that he was surprised to see me, as d-scan was clear ten minutes previous.  I explain that you need to be refreshing that every ten seconds or so.  He asks how he could have beat me.  I explain that in a fight between an Imicus and Loki, there is not much you can do after you get pointed.  Salvagers and probe launchers will not do much against anything but wrecks.</p>

<p>He leaves, and I send him some isk.  He asks why.  I tell him I want new players to be wary, but not afraid to engage in playing the game.</p>

<p>What did I do right?  I found him with d-scan and managed to get to him without doing anything to signal my presence, at least at first.  What did I do wrong?  I need to better prepare my home system for pouncing on targets of opportunity.</p>

<p>What did he do right?  He was moving away from his location, which meant I had to use probes to get to him.  What did he do wrong?  No cloak, not enough checking of d-scan, not aligned to get a fast warp out.  Mostly, he wasn’t paying attention.  He had a solid ten seconds to warp while I was visible and firing but not in point range.</p>

<p>It’s not an impressive kill, but it was a nice chance to practice with a low risk target, at least for me.  It was quite fun to bag a completely solo kill.  I don’t have enough of those.  I hope my target learned a few things about staying alive. Maybe he’ll be back in a few months and catch me out.  I hope so.</p>
