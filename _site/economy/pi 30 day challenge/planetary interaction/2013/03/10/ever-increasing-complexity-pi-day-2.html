<meta name="description" content="In response to my own questions from last post regarding the shortcomings of my production as it was implemented, I went looking at how to use the excess resources from my over-producing R0&gt;P1 planets.  If you are running 4 planets to get the materials for Robotics, you end up with an imbalance among the following P1s:&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chiral Structures&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Precious Metals&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reactive Metals&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Toxic Metals&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;These in turn can be used to create a variety of P2s:&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Consumer Electronics (used in Robotics)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mechanical Parts (used in Robotics)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Enriched Uranium&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Construction Blocks&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;For nice list of all the PI flow charts, take a look at this.  So the question I had to answer was how can I take my excess PI products and make them profitable, and easy to get to market?  The answer, I think, lies in looking at market prices for the P1s and comparing those to the prces for the various potential P2s, and making the P2s which are worth more than the P1s you started with.  Given the high rate of import and export taxes, this is not a trivial calculation.  I’ll let you run your own numbers, but I was able to find a solid excess line, and factor in the estimated overproduction of P1s that are worth more than their P2s, and came up with something like this:&lt;div style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;I haven’t fixed the costs, so expect the import/export to take roughly 10% off each of the non P3s (i’m keeping it at 10% for simplicity, and to account for increased profit as you go up the chain), you get this&lt;div style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Huh.  We are back at roughly 500m isk, and that’s with 5 planets instead of 6, and without Elite Command Centers.  Maybe my doom and gloom from yesterday was a bit premature.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
