<meta name="description" content="Warning, this post contains many charts.Edit: Thanks for the link Mabrick!First:  Mabrick stated this in my last comments section:&lt;blockquote&gt;You have extra R) and P1? The way I deal with extra R0 and P1 is to not have any. That may seem a bit arrogant, but hear me out. Robotics is a 2 extractor, 4xP1 and 2xP2 production chain - per planet. When you get to Elite command centers it will be easier to do, but you should aim for 2 extractors each pulling 288,000 m3 of R0 with 2xP1 facilities per R0 type and 2xP2 facilities to take their product. You then have to move one of the P2 products to another planet to make the Robotics. I move Mechanical Parts to my Lava worlds where I have on additional P3 facility in my setup. Precious Metals is typically the weakest producer across all the planets I’ve run and that’s why I produce Robotics on the Lava worlds. All three Lava planets process 1/3 of my Robotics each. I use no silos and I try and keep a day’s worth of R0 in each Landing Pad as a buffer. To keep this working as stated, I actively adjust my extractors to make sure I don’t over produce, even if that means I remove heads and have grid left over. It’s just easier that way to me. &lt;/blockquote&gt;To answer, in short, I don’t have Elite Command Centers.  The long version is my planets, even after removing the storage facilities I didn’t need, cannot support the mixed production chain he is describing.  In part due to CPU/PG, in part due to low resource distribution.  I am curious to know what planets exist in HS that could support his approach based on resource density.  I’m sure they do, but trying to find the 5-6 planets needed (3 barren, 3 lava), in one system, and also near whatever else you happen to be doing in Eve, seems like chasing after Enigmas.  Below is an example of the resources on one of my planets.  You can argue about ECU placement, but even if I consolidate to one ECU with 10 heads, I end up at about the same production, and then can’t afford the chain Mabrick is describing.&lt;div style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Second:  Extra P1s are looking to be saving grace of my setup.  I can sell those excess materials.  In my mind leaving them on the table is lost isk.  I’ll have numbers to show this later.Third:  I lied.  I used Mabrick’s advice in a different way.  Precious Metals are killing me.  So I played around and realized I have PMs on my factory planet.  Down goes an ECU head, fed into my production line to bolster production a little bit.  Not glamorous, but it should add a little margin.  Unfortunately, I’ve hit a wall in that I can’t keep even one Robotics line going at this point.  See the image below to see the link going off to the ECU, and the current supplies inside the launchpad on my factory planet that supplies the whole P2&gt;P3 chain.&lt;table align=&quot;center&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;It’s lonely in here…&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;You need 288,000 * 2 units on each R0 to keep one robotics line going.  At capped out Command Centers on my Planets, here is what I am getting, with ECUs set to provide coverage of the best hotspots on the planets:&lt;div style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;I’m making up the difference on P2s and P1s that are overproducing the rate limiting R0 (Noble Metals &gt; Precious Metals):&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;So here is where we stand today:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;For the complainers, I know sales tax probably shouldn’t be included in costs, but I haven’t bothered fixing everything yet.  This is feeding into a nice overall graph that will come later, and I haven’t fixed that part yet.  But regardless of the -336,198.31 isk in sales tax, we’re still in the red.  Production is slowing down considerably.
