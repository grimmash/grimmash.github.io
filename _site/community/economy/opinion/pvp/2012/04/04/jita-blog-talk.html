People say they want more, but often regret getting what they want. Is CCP reinforcing nodes, and will Jita get TiDi-ed in the days leading up to the jitahellcamp?  I can see a lot of pilots getting a fresh clone and a few ships to enjoy the pretty colors when hundreds (thousands?) of Tornados, tacklers, Orcas, freighters, pods and god knows what else shows up in Jita.  I know I’m thinking of trying to get good seats, and maybe onto a few killmails.  You might want to set up some safes  now though, for all the good it might do.  If I go or not, this promises to be an interesting few days." />
