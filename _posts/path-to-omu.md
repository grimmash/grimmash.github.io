<h2>The Path to Omu</h2>

One of the most common questions in the Tomb of Annihilation Discord is "How does my party find Omu?".  This post is a general guide to answer that question.

There two ways to answer this question, and we'll go through both.  The first is to consider NPCs who know where Omu is.  The second is to consider the general paths that will lead to Omu.  Let's start with the people.  

<h2>NPCs that Know the Way</h2>

The following NPCs know where Omu is:
- **Eku** the guide
- **The Royal Family** in Kir Sabal
- **Zalkore** the exiled and former Queen of Omu in Nangalore
- **Saja Nbaza** the Oracle in Orolunga
- The **Yellow Banner Company**

You could also easily add in the knowledge to the followling characters:
- **Grandfather Zitembe** in Port Nyanzaru (he may actually know this RAW, but I gave up searching the book after a while)
- **Nanny Pupu** in Mbala.  Especially if you are using DMs Guild content like [Ruins of Mbala](https://www.dmsguild.com/product/307856/Ruins-of-Mbala--maps-and-extra-content-for-Tomb-of-Annihilation#:~:text=High%20above%20the%20dense%20jungles,doctor%20with%20ancient%20magical%20powers.)
- **Artus Cimber**
- **Liara Portyr** in Camp Beluarian or Mezro
- Any of the **Pirates**
- Residents of **Shilku**
- **Valindra Shadowmantle** if you add in multiple encounters or change up the main RAW encounter.
- **Red Wizards**
- **Salida** the guide could know or learn this via her *sending stone*
- Really **anyone you want**, based on how your campaign is going.

It important to note that knowledge of the Soulmonger and knowledge of the location of Omu do NOT need to go hand in hand for any NPC.  It is likely that many NPCs do know the general locale of Omu, but they may not have any reason to think that is related to quest the players are on.  All you really need to decide as GM is if you want to place an NPC in front of the PCs who can help with finding Omu.  You might do this because the PCs are adrift, or you might do it in service of your plot.  Speaking of the plot...

<h2>Narrative Paths to Omu</h2>

If you look at the base map, the party is likely to take one of three paths out of Omu:
- The Western Path following the River Soshenstar to Camps Righteous and Vengeance, the Aldani Basin, Mbala and Orolunga.
- The Eastern Path that may include Fort Beluarian, and eventually finds the River Olung, Mezro, Kir Sabal and Nangalore
- The High Seas path that leads to either Jahaka Anchorage and/or Shilku

These are general paths.  However the rumors and leads in Port Nyanzaru, the geography, the events at points of interest, and even the guides should be driving players towards one of Orolunga, Kir Sabal, or Nangalore.  Getting the PCs to any of those locations should give you the tools you need to point the PCs towards or directly to Omu.  How?
- In **Orolunga** Saja Nbaza should probably literally tell the PCs about Omu, the Tomb of the Nine, and the Soulmonger/  Well maybe not everything, but at least enough to make it obvious where to go.
- In **Nangalore** or **Kir Sabal** you have plenty of NPC motivation to point the PCs towards Omu or at least learn a lot about it.

If you are having a hard time getting to the above locations, you can use Camp Vengeance, the Heart of Ubtao, and/or Fort Beluarian to lay breadcrumb quests to get the PCs close to the other locations.  In some cases the campaign is already written this way, especially regarding the rumors in Port Nyanzaru and the quests available in Camp V.  In the worst case scenario you can inject random encounters with any NPC you wish (see the list above for ideas).  You can then use that encounter or developments from it to tell or prod the PCs towards a useful location or Omu.

Finally, you can always move any of the locations on the map to anywhere you need or want them to be.  In my games, I moved Ome, Hrakhamar and Wyrmheart Mine to the are south of the Sky Lizard Mountains and East of the Peaks of Flame.  This was inresponse to the general direction the PCs were pushing and let me include Lake Luo, Hisari, and the Valley of Embers just for fun!

<h2>Another Option: The Yellow Banner Company</h2>

Another fun option, that I started playing with late in the campaign, was puttin gin campsites from the **Yellow Banner Company**.  If you are not reading ahead much, or just forgot, this is a group of NPCs that was also sent to find the Soulmonger.  Use this to your narrative or plot-driving advantage, and let your PCs encounter the Company's campsites, adventures and trails to lead the players along if all else fails.  

*Side note: The YBC is the real party of one of the authors.  He could never kill them in his home game, so they are brutally slaughtered in the last pages of the campaign book.  Neat.*
