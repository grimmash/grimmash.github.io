<br /><div>A commenter asked me why I keep insisting that the velocity of money is important, so I want to talk about that a little bit.&nbsp; Examples and numbers will be involved!<o:p></o:p></div><div><br /></div><div><o:p>According to the vast knowledge of Wikipedia:</o:p></div><div><o:p><br /></o:p></div><div><o:p></o:p></div><div><i>"The velocity of money (also called velocity of circulation) is the average frequency with which a unit of money is spent on new goods and services produced domestically in a specific period of time."</i><o:p></o:p></div><div><br /></div><br /><div>The main concept behind the velocity of money is that an order that takes 6 hours to complete at a relatively low margin can be far better, in terms of net profit, than an order that takes 24 hours to complete at a high margin.&nbsp; This is because you can repeat the 6 hour order 4 times in 24 hours and end up with a higher net income than the high margin item.</div><div><o:p></o:p></div><div><br /></div><div>Below is a table that illustrates how velocity of isk can work in a completely theoretical manner.&nbsp; The setup is:&nbsp;</div><div></div><ul><li>Widget A can be bought for $100,000, sells for $150,000, and each item sells in 1 hour.</li><li>Widget B can be bought for $1,000,000, sells for $2,000,000, and each item sells in 6 hours.</li><li>The example player starts with $1,000,000 isk.</li><li>Sales tax and broker's fees are ignored.</li></ul><div>Here is what happens in one day (24 hours):</div><div><br /></div><div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://grimmash.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Velocity-220x3001.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://grimmash.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Velocity-220x3001-220x300.png" width="234" /></a></div><div>&nbsp;</div><br />  <div>Widget A is an insane money maker!&nbsp; At the end of one day of trading it made 16 B isk!&nbsp; Obviously this is not a real case.&nbsp; There is no item in the game that moves 100,000+ units an hour and has a price near $100,000.&nbsp; There are also very few items that will consistently flip every single hour of each day.&nbsp; But the theory is sound.&nbsp; Push the Widget numbers out to every 3 hours, and drop a cycle near the beginning to diversify the profits, and you will get a few staggered version of that curve, limited by the daily trading volumes.&nbsp;Widget A&nbsp;will still net far more than just betting on that 1 million isk high margin order!<o:p></o:p></div><div><br /></div><div>In summary: diversify across a lot of small orders that are all moving quickly in order to keep your volume clipping along.&nbsp; Add in big orders as your capital allows you to take longer-term investments.&nbsp; If all of your isk gets tied up in order that take forever to move, you may be missing out on more boring, but useful trades.<o:p></o:p></div>
