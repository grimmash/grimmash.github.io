</span>As much as I’d love to make a crack a Jester’s great caravan of the stars, there are some other ideas I’d like to spin out a little.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>With the hints in CCP’s release at PAX, there’s plenty of opportunity to speculate and put on our tinfoil hats!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I'll put some posts up over the next few days regarding the topics announced in at PAX, and my thoughts regarding those topics. &nbsp;Today I want to talk about exploration a bit.</div><div><br /></div><div>Discovery scanning.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>We have no idea what it is.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I can hope that it is a system that makes the process of scanning sites down more enjoyable.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Currently the dedicated explorer is pigeon holed into a few core concepts.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>You need a scanning ship, either a CovOps or a T3 fit properly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>If you are serious about beating the competition, you probably also have another account with a combat cruiser, again likely a T3, flying with you to jump into those sites as soon as you find them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The choice of useful ships is rather limited, and the fitting requirements to take advantage of those ships narrows the selections even more.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The skills needed to fly the narrow range of suitable ships are not insubstantial.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The skills to utilize the sites are very specific and often have no use outside scanning.</div><div><br /></div><div>This is not bad, per se.</div><div><br /></div><div>What is ugly, however, is the capricious nature of scanning and the tedium of finding and resolving signatures.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>It usually requires a notepad and some patience.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>So how can CCP improve things?</div><div><br /></div><div>First, I’d love to see a change to the dynamics of what ships are allowed into resolved sites.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Specifically, I’d like to see the mechanics work so that if your ship can scan it, your ship can go inside.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>There’s nothing quite like finding a handful of sites in a system, and learning that your cruiser, battlecruiser, or T3 isn’t allowed in.</div><div><br /></div><div>Second, I’d like to see dedicated exploration ships that can fit some of the scanning gear without severely sacrificing the ability to complete the sites.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>While this is primarily true for combat sites, there is only one CovOps that can fit all the modules needed for a scanning roam without needing to dock up to switch modules.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Obviously there are balance issues, as giving a cruiser PvE or PvP tank and gank AND scanning would break aspects of combat scanning.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>But giving each race a cruiser hull with a few more mid slots and scanning bonuses would go a long way towards making solo scanning roams more feasible.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Perhaps make cloaks and probe launchers a dedicated hardpoint?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Perhaps just change the way high-slot hardpoints work by adding specific role-only slots?</div><div><br /></div><div>Third, and tied directly to the first two, scanning needs to be made more possible for solo roamers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>A dedicated scanner should be the fastest and best option, and PvE and PvP fits should excel at those tasks, but reasonable balance should exist that makes scanning and completing sites a one-ship, one-account activity.</div><div><br /></div><div>Fourth, the scanning mechanics need a tweak.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Saved probe formations.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Ship-board logging of sites you have resolved or are working on resolving even if you leave the system or need to dock.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>My ship can hand a neural-interface, route through all of known space, and control weapons, navigation, scanning, targeting, and EWAR at the same time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>It can’t remember how I launch my probes or the data loaded in the scanning system if I close the window?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>And as for the D-Scan, if it can figure out what something is and how far away it is, why can’t I warp to that point in space?</div><div><br /></div><div>Fifth, and most contentious in my mind, is that scanning should be less random in the rewards received. &nbsp;Nothing saps my will to scan like clearing through a half dozen systems and getting nothing for days on end, only to hit the jackpot once in a blue moon. &nbsp;I'd love to see low end rewards boosted with a corresponding reduction in high end rewards. &nbsp;If exploration is to be a viable career in Eve, like mission running or industry, there needs to be a more dependable income stream that comes from it.</div><div><br /></div><div>I'm sure some of these ideas are not feasible, and others, such as ships I consider suitable for scanning and completing sites and rewards, are open to debate. &nbsp;But there are many changes CCP could enact to make exploration more interesting overall, and more enjoyable and accessible. &nbsp;</div><br />
