For a variety of reasons, I have been considering jumping into Faction Warfare. &nbsp;However, I have a few problems:<br /><br />Aside from the popular bloggers' affiliations, I know relatively little about FW. &nbsp;I sense that Amarr and Gallente and in the crapper, based on the control maps. &nbsp;But is this indicative of the level of players involved? &nbsp;Part of me wants to join the little guys and get some fights. &nbsp;But part of me is afraid that there is nothing going on in those militias. &nbsp;Anyone care to share thoughts on this?<br /><br />I am terribad at PvP. &nbsp;Mostly from lack of, well, doing it. &nbsp;I've been a functional carebear for my career in Eve. &nbsp;I put an alt in RvB for a while, which although fun, quickly devolved into Red Blob v Blue Blob, until one side got so outnumbered they had to leave the field for the night. &nbsp;My few attempts to go solo roaming in low sec have brought me nothing in the way of combat. &nbsp;So, any recommendations for gaining PvP skill, or lacking that, practice? &nbsp;Good roaming routes? <br /><br />Thanks in advance to anyone who cares to answer!<br /><br /><br />
