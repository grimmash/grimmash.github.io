<div style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Results for Day 2:</div><div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://grimmash.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Day-21.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://grimmash.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Day-21.png" /></a></div><div style="clear: both; text-align: left;">There you have it. &nbsp;Results are little less than I wanted, as I have a lot of inventory as of writing time. &nbsp;I've been going for low quantity, fast turn over, but that slowed down in the afternoon. &nbsp;The .01 iskers are killing me this afternoon... &nbsp;I got into some nice margins items, but the competition is fierce, and I have not been able to .01 isk it as much as yesterday.</div><div style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Also, a bit of a side note due to financial considerations: if between my current accounts and this experiment I cannot PLEX the market account, I will have 26 days on the market account, so this may be a 28 Day Challenge depending on how well it works.</div><br />
