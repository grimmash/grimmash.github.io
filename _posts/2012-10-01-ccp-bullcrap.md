I have been blitzing L3 missions, trying to repair Caldari faction standing, and came across this:<br /><div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://grimmash.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/wtf-300x1011.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="107" src="http://grimmash.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/wtf-300x1011-300x101.png" width="320" /></a></div>I've mentioned it before, but CCP really has some fun ways of making people want to not play their game. &nbsp;In case it's not obvious, I declined an anti-Gallente mission, as my goal is to get back to 0.0 for all factions, not tank one to raise the other. &nbsp;And the response, after waiting out the decline timer, is to offer me the anti-Minmatar version. &nbsp;With a taunt, no less.<br /><br />Great way to get me hitting the log-off button.
