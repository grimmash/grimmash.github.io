&nbsp;I am waiting for something to happen in CSM7 land. &nbsp;So far we know most of CSM6 is going to run again. &nbsp;Here are my brief thoughts on each, with asterices:<br /><br /><br /><ul><li>The Mitanni - CFC will get him elected, so no point in even paying attention.</li><li>UAxDeath - Not sure what he ever did.</li><li>Two Step* - I like this Two Step, talks a lot, even if I do not agree with some of what he says.</li><li>Seleene* - Useful knowledge of CCP and Eve</li><li>Meissa Anunthial* - Posts frequently on the forums, so hooray!</li><li>Trebor Deahdoow* - Another communicative CSM.</li><li>Prometheus Exenthal - Who?</li><li>Elise Randolph - Again, who?</li></ul><div>Not already on the CSM but making noise:</div><div><ul><li>Kelduum Revaan - Eve Uni CEO, no substantial info or platform yet.</li><li>Mintrolio - "I Love All Secs!" campaign is funny but uninformative.</li><li>T'amber - Moar pink ships, smaller boobs and Serious Business. &nbsp;Probably more interesting than Prometheus, but hey, that's not hard.</li></ul><div>And that's about it so far. &nbsp;I think I saw someone nominating Chribba, but I have doubts. &nbsp;Ripard Teg made a pass at the pretty girl in the bar, then talked himself out of it in a weird bait-and-switch where he failed to make the bait obvious. &nbsp;Not much depth in the field, although I have hopes for The Apostle to start poasting, as those are always a good read.</div><div><br /></div><div>Someone call me when we have new candidates worth caring about.&nbsp;</div></div>
