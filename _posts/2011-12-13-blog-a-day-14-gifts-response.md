A response to <a href="http://poeticstanziel.blogspot.com/2011/12/eve-blog-day-014-ccp-holiday-gifts.html" target="_blank">Poetic Discourse</a>.<br /><br />This is a tough choice of gift!<br /><br />I already bought and am researching the BPOs offered, so that is rather pointless. &nbsp;I could care less about the destroyers and faction ammo. &nbsp;But weighing an implant v a remap, that is tough. &nbsp;I need to look up the info on the remap, as I am not sure if it is an instant thing or if it gets added to my character to use at any point. &nbsp;If it the second option, that may be a no-brainer. &nbsp;This could be a nice ace in the hole if I get bored of my Per-Wil Map of Doom (tm).<br /><br />
