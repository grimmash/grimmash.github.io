&nbsp;We spot two Tempests chilling at the gate to a complex. &nbsp;We manage to hold discipline, warp in, land tackles, and most of us orbit under the Tempest guns. &nbsp;I'm in a long-point Atron, so my job is mostly holding one of the Tempests. &nbsp;Things are going fine until they go pear shaped. &nbsp;Drones come out and start taking a toll. &nbsp;A few frigs are orbiting too far out, and are taking fire from the 800mm shells the Tempests are raining upon us. &nbsp;Eventually I realize I have a stack of drones chipping away at my armor at alarming speed. &nbsp;I burn out, as things are falling apart. &nbsp;I manage to make it out of scram range in deep structure and warp out. &nbsp;The Tempests hold the field, with one nearly out of hull.<br /><br />A few things went wrong. &nbsp;A few frigs managed to orbit into those 800mm shells. &nbsp;I failed to focus on the drones soon enough to mitigate the incoming damage. &nbsp;This fight was far from a given on either side. &nbsp;Had we downed one of the battleships while losing our hulls, it would have been a victory, but we came up just short. &nbsp;Perhaps I should have kept my blasters on the Tempest, and perhaps I should have targeted drones sooner. &nbsp;Both would have eliminated half of the incoming damage or more. &nbsp;This was a better managed fight, but still eluded us.<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;">***</div><br />I had some victories today as well, a few kills that padded my efficiency. &nbsp;I got part of a kill in my first pirate act in Eve. &nbsp;A fellow militia mate and I fell to an obvious mismatch out of stubborn anger and honor. &nbsp;It was a good day overall. &nbsp;I look forward to the next.<br /><br /><br />
