I'll start at the end:&nbsp; I bought ESO about a month ago, and I am not subscribing.<br /><br />Ok, that's out of the way.&nbsp;&nbsp; This will be a short review, and I'll try to focus on the good and the bad,<br /><br />Good Things<br /><br />The game is very, very pretty.&nbsp; I have to commend the developers on that front.&nbsp; Likewise the music and voice acting are quite nice.<br /><br />Not so good things<br /><br />The game is slow.&nbsp; Almost glacial.
