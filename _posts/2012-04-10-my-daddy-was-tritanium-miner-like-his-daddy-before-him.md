<a href="http://grimmash.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Tritanium21.png" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://grimmash.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Tritanium21.png" /></a>I never thought mining, drones or salvaging would become the hot topic they have lately. &nbsp;To read the blogs, you would think Eve is going to implode in a few weeks... &nbsp;But oh what a beautiful implosion it shall be. &nbsp;A few things about the incoming changes.<br /><br /><b>Short Term</b><br />Buy you gear now. &nbsp;I mean it. &nbsp;I've been quietly building a small stockpile of minerals, and the value is increasing just by letting it sit. &nbsp;Weapons, modules and ammo haven't caught up yet, ships are already starting to. &nbsp; Thinking of moving to that WH? &nbsp;Buy your Drakes, Retrievers and haulers now. &nbsp;Maybe some fuel... &nbsp;I think in a few weeks weeks you'll be wishing you laid in supplies for a hot summer. &nbsp;Speaking of which...<br /><br /><b>Update Your Queue</b><br />Want to gank some shiny hulks? &nbsp;Best get those last few skills ready now. &nbsp;I predict miners are going to be hiding for most of the summer. &nbsp;Better get in on the initial kills, because Hulks are already ~50 mil more than they were this time last year. &nbsp;Can't wait to see the price on those pop up over 300 or 400 mil. &nbsp;Want to be ready for the clear(ish) skies after Hulkageddon? &nbsp;That takes a bit of training. &nbsp;And if you want to use those minerals you will eventually be mining.....<br /><br /><b>Research</b><br />Want to cash in on resupplying all those ships and mods? &nbsp;Get your BPOs or BPCs before that chain gets hit like a brick. &nbsp;You know those manufacturers are going to have a field day trickling out the nuts and bolts of New Eden, so you might want to have your own supply chain going, and get a jump on some of the slots if you are a high-sec-er. &nbsp;And if you make a lot of your cash from salvage...<br /><br /><b>Inventory</b><br />Take a look at your hangars. &nbsp;Do you need all that stuff? &nbsp;Is your Noctis worth hanging on to? &nbsp;Have you moved things to useful locations? &nbsp;If Jita goes down and the minerals dry up, a lot of things are going to change. &nbsp;Hulkageddon often has casualties beyond just the barges in the belts. &nbsp;Should you start stocking up on things you know will sell if a few weeks/months? <br /><br />A lot of markets are going to change soon, so you better get out in front of the changes, or get ready to pay a bit more for your bottles of Space Perrier, er, Quafe.
