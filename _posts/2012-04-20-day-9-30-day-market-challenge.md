Results:<br /><div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://grimmash.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Day-91.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://grimmash.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Day-91.png" /></a></div>Not too much to say today. &nbsp;I am going to be gone over the weekend (Days 10 and 11), and I have been trading in Jita so far. &nbsp;My plan, given the whole "Jita Burns" event on the 24th, is to let my orders wind down while I am gone and move shop when I get back. &nbsp;I suspect business will not be good once the camp hits, and I plan to be out of the way. &nbsp;In order to stay true to my plan, I am going to move only myself when I go. &nbsp;Since I will be missing this weekend, it seems fair to move when my orders have essentially stopped, and just transfer my pool of isk.<br /><br />Due to all of this, I expect a loss come next post due to losing some broker's fees.<br /><br />
