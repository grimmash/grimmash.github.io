# Requirements

- **Foundry VTT** with the following mods:
  - [Vehicles and Mechanisms](https://github.com/grandseiken/foundryvtt-vehicles-and-mechanisms)
  - [Multilevel Tokens](https://github.com/grandseiken/foundryvtt-multilevel-tokens) *this is a dependency of the above*
- Map Art with *tiles* for the Gears
- A little bit of patience

# Setup

1. Set up the map as normal with walls, tokens, lights, whatever you want
2. Create three characters (type does not matter) with easy to recall names that will represent you gears.  I like something along the lines of Gear1, Gear2, Gear3
3. Place tokens for those characters on the map, preferably somewhere outside the walls where the PCs could ever see them
