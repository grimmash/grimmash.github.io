Hello!<br /><br />I've been so busy playing Eve and working on stuff for me new corp that I haven't had time to polish up any of my articles.&nbsp; I guess that is a good thing...<br /><br />Since I have a bit of a backlog, and a tentpole series as Jester would call it, I am going to hold of on posting the longer articles until I get them finished up.&nbsp; I am also going to wait a bit, as I am finalizing a relaunch of my site.<br /><br />Yep!&nbsp; Pretty soon I will migrate to a newer, cleaner, more controllable website.&nbsp; All the old stuff here and comments will port over, but I will have better tools to share pictures, archive guides and resources, and some of the other stuff I am looking to try out.&nbsp; So keep an eye on this space, as a belated spring cleaning is on the way!<br /><br />Fly smart!
