<div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://grimmash.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/PI-300x2081.png" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="222" src="http://grimmash.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/PI-300x2081-300x208.png" width="320" /></a></div>As mentioned previously, I am rather space-broke at the moment. &nbsp;To me this means less that a few hundred million isk in my account, above what is earmarked for purchases. &nbsp;So I've started two endeavors: <br /><br />The first is a relaunch of the <a href="http://69.89.31.225/~grimmash/2013/03/04/30-day-market-challenge-wrap-up/" target="_blank">30 Day Market Challenge</a>. &nbsp;I messed up the start already, after seeding 20 mil, I noticed I had about 70 mil in modules from the last go-around. &nbsp;Stupid numbers making accounting hard. &nbsp; I'm aiming to clear 10% margins each day, at least up to the billion isk range. &nbsp;We'll see how it goes. &nbsp;Preliminary actions in Jita seem to indicate margins have gotten tighter on just about everything since the same time last year. &nbsp;As long as the isk flows, I'll be happy. &nbsp;Not sure about daily updates, it may be more of a when I feel like it thing.<br /><br />The second project is based on a <a href="http://mabricksmumblings.blogspot.com/2013/03/why-be-poor-noob.html" target="_blank">post over at Mabrick's</a>. &nbsp;He seems convinced that HS planets can rake in 100m isk a week. &nbsp;I'm starting with 5 planets, and a lower level of command center upgrades, but I'll be posting my results over the next few days. &nbsp;You can all judge based on that. &nbsp;We'll call this one the Precocious Pod-dweller's Planetary Puzzle. &nbsp; Or something.<br /><br />Once the prelims are taken care of on the money front, I'll be making good on my overtures to join FW. &nbsp;I have the good fortune of having an old real life friend involved in a decent position in one of the factions, so I can jump right in with some larger actions once I get ships moved about.
