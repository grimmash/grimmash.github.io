What is the point of encounters in your game?  Specfically, combat encounters.  What purpose do they serve?  If you are running a module, should you run every combat encounter or random table roll exactly as it is written?  This post will investigate these questions.  Hopefully this post will also give you some food for thought about how to design or run or *not* run encounters in various situations.

I am assuming a DnD 5e or similar system or environment here.  This implies that encounters are usually *combat* encounters, or have a high percentage chance to transform into combat encounters.  I'll talk about that directly where I think it is relevant.

<h3>Why run combat encounters at all?</h3>

The first question to ask for any potential combat encounter you design or plan to run is "What purpose does this encounter serve?".  The answer is likely in this list:

- The encounter is narratively important
- The players have created the encounter via their actions
- The module you are running says there is an encounter
- You want to deplete resources off the party
- You or the PCs rolled an encounter on a table
- You put an encounter there (or the writer did) because that is what you do in ttrpgs


Each of these is worth thinking about.

<h3>Narrative Encounters</h3>

In my opinion these are the "best" encounters.  They exist to reveal characters, factions or other information in the world.

> You see a group of soldiers camped in the meadow beside the road you have been traveling on, and there is a roadblock with armed men before you. The banners and armor bear a marking of a house that you have never seen before.  What do you do next?

The encounter may be the culmination of other events in the game.

>You have fought through the lair of Gary the Mad Necromancer.  Entering his sanctum you see guttering candles, shelves of books, and a strange, glowing set of runes in the center of the floor.  Gary is floating a foot off the ground behind the runes, a leering grin on his face.  He awaits your next move.

In some way, a narrative encounter either pays off something the players have been working towards, adds more knowledge or motivation to the game, or reveals new information about the world.  This may not always end in combat, but it can, and that is fine.  I love this sort of encounter.

<h3>The players made the combat encounter happen</h3>

These are combat encounters you might not have planned for, but the players have forced via their actions.  The "good" ones are organic emergent gameplay.  The less "good" ones are when your party goes full murder hobo, but that can also be twisted to your evil game-running purposes.  Either way, these encounters are likely "good".  I fully believe that any time the players start telling you the story and the structure of the session you are in a moderately good place, game wise.

The place to be concerned about player driven combat encounters is if your players keep causing fights with NPCs you did not expect a fight with.  This could have a lot of causes, including but not limited to:
- Bored players who are starting fights because they can't figure out anything else to do.  
- Poor information flow between you and the players about the specific situation.
- Some other massive disconnect between how you and the players are perceiving the game world.

This is when we bring out the classic "talk to your players" line to make sure everyone can get on the same page.  Especially if you are not expecting all scenes to turn into combat encounters.  You may need to adapt how you are presenting information or roleplaying to the players so they understand that combat is not the only outcome.

<h3>The Module says FIGHT!</h3>

There are a few main reasons the module puts a fight somewhere:
- It has a narrative purpose (see above)
- It is cool
- It is a way to deplete resources

You knew that things would get murky, right?  The first two reasons are fine, and if that seems to be the case, just run it!  The third case is worth talking about.

Most of the popular systems that focus on miniature or tactical combat assume some sort of standard adventuring day and a curve of resource depletion over the course of that standard adventuring day.  Resources here means limited use abilities, spell slots, class features, consumables, etc.  But... there often isn't a tool in game that forces the PCs to keep going.  They can easily take rests, or set up camp, or just not move in a linear fashion.

Your job as a the DM is then to decide how you are running the game.  **Do you care about forcing resource depletion?  If so, and your players like that style of game, great.  Run it!**  

On the other hand, if you want all combat to serve a larger purpose, narratively or thematically or from a gameplay perspective, you have more choices and knobs and levers than just throwing in filler encounters.  Rework the necessary encounters to have waves or challenges or fun gimmicks.  Bump up the challenge rating or difficulty.  Combine multiple encounters to ratchet up the tension.  Use traps or hazards or other methods to deplete resources or drive the game forward.

The point of this section is that you should critically evaluate any filler encounters and decide if they really serve your game.  Nothing says you have to follow a module as written, so follow the path that your players and you will enjoy most!

<h3>You want to deplete party resources</h3>

See above!

<h3>A combat encounter was rolled on a table</h3>

Another tricky one.  I like random tables... when they are well thought out and match the goals of the game you are trying to run.  The 5e DMG tables are fine for a Westmarches style game.  The Tomb of Annihilation random encounters for the hexcrawl and Omu mostly suck.  For Omu you need to roll multiple times just to figure out all the details.  But there is a way to split the difference between letting the dice take the wheel and running a railroad.  The answer is to make curated random tables!

I did this heavily in my current campaign.  For ToA's hexcrawl, I curated every event and placed them on the map such that we would get to most of the things I wanted to show the players.  The random table was the map itself.  The players picked where to go and slowly uncovered all the things they needed to see.

For Omu, I took the material as presented, made my own random table shell, then picked only the events that I actually wanted to run.  Some of these I made up.  By doing this I got to control the timing and likelihood of "random" events so that we still got the flavor of randomness, while staying within guardrails of things I did and did not want to have happen.
