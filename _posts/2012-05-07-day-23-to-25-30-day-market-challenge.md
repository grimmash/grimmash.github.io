Results:<br /><div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://grimmash.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Day-23-24-25-300x1381.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="148" src="http://grimmash.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Day-23-24-25-300x1381-300x138.png" width="320" /></a></div>Bit of a slow weekend for a few reasons. &nbsp;First, I was not that motivated. &nbsp;Second I was amazingly busy with wedding planning and an arm injury. &nbsp;Third, Amarr got the best of me and I decided to move on to another hub. &nbsp;This lead to selling off stock at lower than expected prices in order to not be hauling anything besides skillbooks when I left.<br /><br />Interestingly, it seems that a few weeks after I get into an hub, other traders come join the party and margins go way down, .01 isk wars go way up, and I find it better to move to another spot. &nbsp;I am wondering if others have noticed this in the day trading scene? &nbsp;It makes sense that people follow the money, and I am starting to think a huge part of this is anticipating the changes and staying ahead of that curve. &nbsp;I don't have the isk to do full blown manipulation, but I wonder how many people are out there that can and do crash margins for a few days to get rid of people like me.<br /><br />Another thought: &nbsp;Weekends suck for market trading. &nbsp;All the weekend warriors come out, run missions, sell stock and undercut the bejesus out of things (or so I imagine). &nbsp;In the worst case, someone with a lot of stock follows suit after &nbsp;a few small orders undercut, and drops their price considerably. Then the profit on flipping 20-30 modules disappears into the CCP database forever. &nbsp;Or maybe I just need more isk and better tracking tools to engage in longer term investments. &nbsp;Investing versus day trading if you will.<br /><br />Final thought. &nbsp;I finished collecting all my remote buys before leaving Amarr space. &nbsp;It made me a few million, but nothing even resembling the numbers I am going for, and certainly not enough to be worth the time it took to gather the items. &nbsp;I trashed about half of them after looking at the margins. &nbsp;Future remote buy orders will need to be tailored much more specifically at mini-hubs in the region so I am only going to a few systems to get my inventory and flipping it becomes less of a chore. I am starting to really dislike the region limit on modifying orders as well. &nbsp;With instantaneous interstellar communication, I fail to see (outside of gameplay mechanics) why we can't at least phone in order modifications.
