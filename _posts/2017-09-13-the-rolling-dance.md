I wrote this while bored.&nbsp; Enjoy, or not.

Rolling!
Rolling-Dance!

Ah we can roll if we want to , we can roll those krabs behind
Cause your krabs don't fight and if they don't fight
Well they're no krabs of mine
I say, we can roll where we want to, to place where fights are gud
And we can act like we come from out of wormholes
Leave the k-space far behind
And we can roll

We can roll if we want to , we can roll those krabs behind
Cause your krabs don't fight and if they don't fight
Well they're no krabs of mine
I say, we can roll where we want to, to place where fights are gud
And we can act like we come from out of wormholes
Leave the k-space far behind
And we can roll

Rollers!
Ah we can roll when we want to, the hole is dead and there's no reds
And we can fit real dank from our drones to our tank
And surprise 'em with the victory cry

I say we can pew if want to if we don't nobody will
And you can act real rude and totally removed
And i can act like an imbecile
I say we can roll, we can roll everything out of control
We can roll, we can roll we're doing it hole to hole
We can roll, we can roll everybody look at d-scans
We can roll, we can roll everybody takin' the hole
Rolling dance
Oh well the rolling dance
Ah yes the rolling dance

Rolling
Rolling-dance

We can roll if we want to, we've got all your night and mine
As long as we abuse it, never gonna lose it
Everything'll work out right
I say, we can roll if we want to we can leave your krabs behind
Cause your krabs don't fight and if they don't fight
Well they're are no krabs of mine
I say we can roll, we can roll everything out of control
We can roll, we can roll we're doing ithole to hole
We can roll, we can roll everybody look at d-scans
We can roll, we can roll everybody takin' the hole
Oh well the rolling dance

Ah yes the rolling dance
Oh well the rolling dance
Oh well the rolling dance
Oh yes the rolling dance
Oh the rolling dance yeah
Oh it's the rolling dance

It's the rolling dance
Well it's the rolling dance
Oh it's the rolling dance
Oh it's the rolling dance
Oh it's the rolling dance
Oh it's the rolling dance
