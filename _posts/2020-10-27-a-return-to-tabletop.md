This weeks marks the thirteenth session of my new Dungeons & Dragons 5e campaign.  I am DMing the Tomb of Annihilation campaign on roll20.net, and it has been a lot of fun.  Pretty soon I'll have a page up with the session posts, and I am going to start putting some thoughts about the whole process down here.  Some topics I am looking to cover:

Addons <br />
Dealing with the jungle<br />
Crafting<br />
A place to call home<br />
Dealing with a large player party<br />
Thoughts on 5e<br />
Some new monsters<br />

So lots of things I am thinking about!
