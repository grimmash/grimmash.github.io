This weeks marks the thirteenth session of my new Dungeons & Dragons 5e campaign.  I am DMing the Tomb of Annihilation campaign on roll20.net, and it has been a lot of fun.  Pretty soon I'll have a page up with the session posts, and I am going to start putting some thoughts about the whole process down here.  Some topics I am looking to cover:

*How to start the campaign
*Addons
*Dealing with the jungle
*Crafting
*A place to call home
*Dealing with a large player party
*Thoughts on 5e
*Some new monsters

So lots of things I am thinking about!
