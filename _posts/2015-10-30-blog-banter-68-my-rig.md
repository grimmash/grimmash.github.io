<b>What do you play Eve on? I'll show you mine if you show me yours! Are you pew-pewing on a laptop? Plotting universal domination on a 12 monitor set up? Mining away on a 50" TV? Is your set up located where your other half can speak to you or do you lock yourself away for hours in your Eve themed shed? How do you play your important internet spaceships?</b>

Been a while since I've done one of these, so.

Here is my gaming rig:

<a href="http://grimmash.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/desk.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-623" src="http://grimmash.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/desk-300x169.jpg" alt="desk" width="300" height="169" /></a>

As one you can see, I like monitors.  Two 23", one 21.5".  If I could, I'd have more and matching monitors, but there is a limit to how much money my better half lets me dump into things.  I have two mice, one gaming, and one trackball, because I like variety.  The HOTAS is mounted to my desk chair, but can be somewhat quickly mounted or unmounted with a few bolts and wing nuts.  I use a Saitek X55.  Keyboard is a Das Keyboard, which I highly recommend.  Mine has the letters on the keys, because although I can type quickly, I can't actually touch type, which is my not-so-secret nerd failing.  The beer and water are key tools to every gaming session.
