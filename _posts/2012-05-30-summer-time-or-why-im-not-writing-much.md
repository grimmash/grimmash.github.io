Hello! &nbsp;Not dead over here, just resting. &nbsp;I figured now would be as a good a time as any to let people know that my slowdown in blogging is due to a few factors, and will likely continue for the next few months. &nbsp;A lot happened over the last two weeks, and few things are coming, namely:<br /><br /><ul><li>I got a full time internship that pays real money, and lasts all summer!</li><li>I had to (got the chance) move to DC for the internship!</li><li>Sightseeing!</li><li>I'm getting married in two months!</li><li>It's summer.</li></ul><div>So yeah, Eve is a bit back seat for the short term, and if Eve is back seat, the blog comes after I get to play :). &nbsp;Anyhow, thanks to those who are coming by to read! &nbsp;I'll still be posting, and still playing, but I'm focused on some other things for the time being.</div>
