Fweddit came to Hikkoken tonight. <br /><div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://grimmash.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/fwed1.png" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://grimmash.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/fwed1.png" /></a></div><br />Word came in that the Amarr Militia wanted to come over and fight. &nbsp;I guess they needed a break from getting <a href="http://dl1.eve-files.com/media/corp/VeriteFW/FWinfluence.png" target="_blank">shoved around by the Minmatar</a>? &nbsp;However you look at it, they made it known when they wanted a fight, and we started preparing. &nbsp;But not well enough.<br /><br />We got about 30 pilots together, and sent out scouts. &nbsp;Much bouncing through systems and plexes ensued. &nbsp;As the Golden Glob was approaching one jump out, we learned they had significantly more numbers and organizations that we did. &nbsp;10 logis, and another 50 or so cruisers. &nbsp;We had about 5 logi and 20 cruisers with some frigates for fun. &nbsp;A frantic align and warp got us out of Pyn and back into Nennemaila, and reshipping began. &nbsp;ECM was added, the call was sent out, and we eventually got up to around 60 people. &nbsp;Fweddit was nice enough to wait next door while we tried to make the fight more interesting.<br /><br />After a bit too long a wait for some tastes, we undocked and flew to Hikkoken. &nbsp;The dirty slavers had taken up residency in the Medium plex of the Cadlari pig-dogs, and we warped on in to have at them! &nbsp;It started out nicely, but over time the greater logi support of Fweddit and their tighter organization began to win out. &nbsp;Our target calling started well but broke down part way through the fight. &nbsp;A few mistakes left our fleet a bit scattered on the field, and we reached the point where our DPS could not break the Fweddit reps. &nbsp;Even though we could reship next door, the <a href="http://eve-kill.net/?a=kill_related&amp;kll_id=16990357" target="_blank">visiting team won the day</a>. &nbsp;To make matters worse, someone had the bright idea to put an fast locking Thrasher on the Nenn staition, and a few of us <a href="http://eve-kill.net/?a=kill_detail&amp;kll_id=16990274" target="_blank">got podded</a> while trying to reship. &nbsp;Fweddit also had some ships that seemed to be dedicated to podding us out of the fight. &nbsp;After my second cruiser went, I found myself in Athinard instead of Nenn, and that was it for the night.<br /><br />A few lessons:<br /><div></div><div><ul><li>Fweddit was nice enough to let us even up the odds, but that's not the norm.</li><li>Signal calling is very important. &nbsp;Both in this fight and a previous spat today, slow and/or confused target calling had an impact on the fight as a whole.</li><li>Keeping your fleet in a decent place for reps and targets is also key. &nbsp;Getting ships strung out over 80km of space makes reps hard to manage.</li><li>Fleet doctrines and organization can make a huge difference.</li></ul>Thanks to Fweddit for being good sports! &nbsp;It was a fun fight, regardless of the outcome. &nbsp;And double thanks to the Gallente logi pilots who kept my Thorax going far longer than it had any reason to. &nbsp;That was awesome!</div><br /><br />
