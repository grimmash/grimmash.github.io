Just a quick reminder, although it might me a bit late or irrelevant to you. &nbsp;Skills for flying a lot of ships are changing come June 4, and you should be ready by doing a few things:<br /><div></div><div><ul><li>If you have Destroyers V and Battlecruisers V update your clone to hold about 6-7 million more skill points.</li><li>If you don't have those skill trained, that sucks, but train them as far as you can.</li><li>If you have BC V, train all the racial cruisers to at least III, and inject Command Ships so as to get the <strike>racial Command Ship skills</strike> receive ranks in the skill (<strong>Edited based on comment 5/18/13)</strong>.</li><li>Look at the links posted further down in this post to see if there are other ships that you can essentially skill into come patch day.</li></ul>Here is a nice picture that illustrates some of the changes, stolen from a very useful Eve University <a href="http://forum.eveuniversity.org/viewtopic.php?f=29&amp;t=65344&amp;sid=a21276bb3c28d012c7a8ce28c4acd4be">forum post</a>:<br /><div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://grimmash.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Odysey-Skills-300x2361.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="251" src="http://grimmash.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Odysey-Skills-300x2361-300x236.png" width="320" /></a></div><br /><br />This <a href="http://community.eveonline.com/news/dev-blogs/74234">dev blog</a> has more details.<br /><br />If you are a player who is fairly well along the way to a lot of T2 ships, command ships, or who remembered to train Destroyers and Battlecruisers to V, but forgot about the other requirements, you should troll through both the posts I linked to make sure you get the most out of the skill changes. &nbsp;I just double checked everything, and I'm glad I did. &nbsp;My industry character had a few skills I needed to put in my queue so as to benefit from all the changes. &nbsp;He will retain the ability to fly an awful lot of ships come Odyssey. &nbsp;Even if he can't fit any of the weapons that would make them useful...<br /><br />The most important thing is to get all your racial frigate skills to IV, racial cruisers to III, and Destroyers and Battlecruisers to V.&nbsp;</div>
