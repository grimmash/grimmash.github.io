A resonse to <a href="http://poeticstanziel.blogspot.com/2011/11/eve-blog-day-005-eve-podcasts.html" target="_blank">Poetic Discourse</a>.<br /><b><br /></b><br /><b>What I Listen To:</b><br /><br /><a href="http://www.voicesfromthevoid.net/" target="_blank">Voices from the Void</a> - Usually informative, always entertaining, and yeah, Arydanika has a voice that is just plain fun to hear. &nbsp;Seismic Stan is a nice addition/replacement.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.podgoo.com/" target="_blank">Ender Black's &nbsp;Pod Goo</a> - Nice range of interviews and topics covered. &nbsp;Nice approach to analyzing tactics and strategies.<br /><br /><b>What Don't I Listen To (And Why):</b><br /><br /><a href="http://www.flyreckless.com/" target="_blank">Fly Reckless </a>- Never seemed to stick for me, I think the in-jokes got too thick when I was trying to listen.<br /><br />Isk (iTunes) - This is personal: &nbsp;I am trying to be a good former smoker and listening to someone light up on the podcast is infuriating and tempting. &nbsp;Also, sometimes the format is waaay to long.<br /><br />Ransoms and Roams: &nbsp;Tried to listen, did not hold my attention.<br /><br /><b>What I Wished Was Still Around:</b><br /><br />Lost In Eve<br /><br /><b>General Thoughts:</b><br /><br />I find that podcasts that have a high production level (like a radio show) tend to keep my attention. &nbsp;As I am constantly working, studying, or moving around, being able to stop and start listening, or listening to little segments at each go is very useful to me. VandV does this well.<br /><br />Consistency (even if it means short episodes) is the second biggest influence on me spending ear time on a show.<br /><br />The podcaster's voice is also huge. &nbsp;I know that much is this is due to fate and your parents, but a good voice is much nicer to listen to. &nbsp;Proper diction and pacing can help overcome otherwise unappealing voices though, as can engagement in what is being said.
