Here's the update:<br /><div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://grimmash.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Balance-Day-111.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://grimmash.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Balance-Day-111.png" /></a></div>Trending a little bit better. &nbsp;I got the Precious Metals output a bit higher, and now Chiral Structures are the rate limiting factor. &nbsp;This means I'm pulling in an extra 1.4m or so per day on Enriched Uranium sales. &nbsp;The POCO taxes have taken about 16m in profits at the 10% high sec rate. &nbsp;That's not 10%. &nbsp;That's an effective tax rate of about 18%.<br /><div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://grimmash.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Eff-Tax-11-300x1621.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="173" src="http://grimmash.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Eff-Tax-11-300x1621-300x162.png" width="320" /></a></div><br /><br />They get you coming and going! &nbsp;Interstingly, the tax rates are pegged to old values, with P1s going for 50isk/unit and P2s going for 900isk/unit, and P3s for 7000isk/unit. &nbsp;This results in interesting tax rate anomolies as shown above. &nbsp;There are a few errors, as I lumped a few things together in the beginning and I can't sort the out now. &nbsp;Stupid March 11. &nbsp;But the overall tax rate of 18% is correct. &nbsp;If I had no taxes, I'd be at about 51m in profit 11 days in.<br /><br />Edit: &nbsp;My original effective tax chart was poorly formatted. &nbsp;I updated it.
