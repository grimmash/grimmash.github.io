Results:<br /><div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://grimmash.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Day-141.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://grimmash.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Day-141.png" /></a></div>Late update, but I had a large presentation today and Wednesdays are always slow for me given my schedule. Anyhow, the only big news is that I royally borked an order by typing the wrong digit into a sell order and losing about 10m in potential profit as I sold to barely over my buy orders. &nbsp;If you missed it, I culled some knowledge into the post immediately preceding this one in order to try and actually teach people a few things that I have learned in the last two weeks.<br /><br />Tomorrow I plan on putting up some pretty charts that show some fun stats about my adventures. &nbsp;Lines! &nbsp;Colors! Invented terms!<br /><br />Also, anyone notice that PLEX prices seem to be creeping down? &nbsp;That's good news for me. &nbsp;I am trying to go all PLEX in Eve Online, so I will embrace the falling price trend.
