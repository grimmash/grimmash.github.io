Just a quick update on the PI challenge. &nbsp;I've made lots of tweaks to max out extraction. &nbsp;Last update, I was at about -9.3m isk on the whole affair. &nbsp;Today's total running numbers:<br /><div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://grimmash.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/PI-Day-81.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://grimmash.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/PI-Day-81.png" /></a></div>I broke into the black! &nbsp;And so far, over 8 days, I've averaged a little over 2 million per day in profit. &nbsp;In revenue, I've averaged about 8 million. &nbsp;8m x 30 days is 240m isk. &nbsp;For the 500m isk goal, this thing is probably going to be a complete failure. &nbsp;Assuming no more costs, I'll be surprised if I get much past the 200m mark.<br /><br />Some mid-challenge analysis. &nbsp;In 2.5 hours, while working on other stuff, I went mining today. &nbsp;The sales from that were 29.3m isk. &nbsp;On another front, I ran a max run of Phased Plasma L ammo. &nbsp;That sold for 18m isk. &nbsp;So in less than the time it took me to do a week's PI, I netted 47m isk into my pocket, for less actual effort than the PI. &nbsp;I have no idea what that ammo cost me to make, because the materials were lying around, but there you have it.<br /><br />This brings up a bigger question: &nbsp;What is the most enjoyable way to secure income in only high sec space? &nbsp;So far PI is ranking very low. &nbsp;It's active playing when I'm doing it, unlike mining. &nbsp;It lacks the explosions of mission running. &nbsp;It's more intensive than manufacturing. &nbsp;There is training time to consider, but based on where I stand in the game so far the PI challenge has been more frustration than fun, and the perceived effort of this PI setup is tedious at best.<br /><br />Tomorrow: My first foray into Faction Warfare! &nbsp;Teaser: &nbsp;I'm terribad!
