Well, it's summer again. &nbsp;Living in the upper Midwest means swings of 38 F to 95 F within a day or two, leading to the lovely situation where my car is full of winter coats and beach towels. &nbsp;Well, maybe that was a week or two ago. &nbsp;But reveling in the psychotic nature of the season has left me almost no time to play Eve recently, along with my final finals, and an impending three-week trip. &nbsp;I'll be gone until mid June, so I hope everyone has a fun Odyssey launch, and try not to completely wreck the place while I'm gone!<br /><br />Maybe the launcher will work by the time I return?<br /><br /><br />
