Results:<br /><div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://grimmash.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Day-17-amp-18-300x1881.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="200" src="http://grimmash.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Day-17-amp-18-300x1881-300x188.png" width="320" /></a></div><div style="clear: both; text-align: left;">It's another double day. &nbsp;Weekends are a pain in the butt to keep updated, so I didn't really bother to try this weekend.</div><div style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="clear: both; text-align: left;">I also bent the rules (or broke them). &nbsp;I've started reprocessing some items that are essentially printing isk. &nbsp;I moved a large order of modules to another hub to not lose out on some 20m in profit. &nbsp;I have also deployed long term buy orders across many stations that I will pick up once a month or so. &nbsp;None of these things required any extra skills training though. &nbsp;I am in the process of getting a throwaway Badger going, as I will need some hauling capacity later. &nbsp;Finally, I am also reselling skills, because apparently people are too lazy to fly one jump. &nbsp;I'll take their money gladly.</div><div style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="clear: both; text-align: left;">The biggest change in the last few days is I have gotten out of the Tech II market almost completely. &nbsp;It's rather hard to compete with players throwing around billions in orders, whereas the the lower volume in some of the meta mods is a bit more manageable and bulk buying power is a bit less annoying.</div><div style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="clear: both; text-align: left;">I've also spent a bit more time trolling orders looking for those buy-order-fill orders, and items that are way below the next group of sells orders. &nbsp;That's a nice quick way to flip inventory and make small margins on it.</div><div style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Oh, there was one other thing. &nbsp;I cleared both the PLEX goal AND half a bil! &nbsp;Woo!</div><br />
