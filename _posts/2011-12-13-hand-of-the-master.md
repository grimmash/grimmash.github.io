This post is from the Dept. of Metal Headgear.<br /><div><br /></div><div>In no particular order, here are some things that have happened recently:</div><div><br /></div><div><ul><li>In game PLEX prices have gone up.</li><li>PLEX sales may have curbed this, but a new, higher equilibrium seems to be forming.</li><li>PI supply has been constrained, thereby increasing demand, and prices.</li><li>Further, long term costs of PI via POCOs, have increased, further altering the supply and demand curve</li><li>New ships (with higher mineral reqs) have been added, eating into the mineral market.</li><li>Anomalies were adjusted up, slightly.</li><li>Incursions have increased ISK supply.</li></ul><div>Taken as a whole I see this turn of events interesting. &nbsp;Eve has inflation. &nbsp;Others games have dealt with this via simply resetting portions of the economy, or the entire thing, each expansion. &nbsp;For an example, look at WoW's continual rebalancing of rewards and looting mechanics. &nbsp;CCP is rightfully loathe to do this given the more long-term game Eve players engage in. &nbsp;But, the ISK faucets flow, and as players amass ISK, prices increase. &nbsp;The options to combat this are either find massive ISK sinks, or tweak the economy. &nbsp;Let's take a quick look at faucets and sinks:</div></div><div><br /></div><div>Faucets</div><div><ul><li>Missions</li><li>Incursions&nbsp;</li><li>Bounties&nbsp;</li><li>Insurance Payouts&nbsp;</li><li>NPC Buy Orders</li></ul><div>Sinks</div></div><div><ul><li>BPOs&nbsp;</li><li>Skillbooks&nbsp;</li><li>LP Purchases</li><li>NPC Taxes and Fees</li><li>PI Costs (Building and import.export fees)</li></ul><div>At the current rates players can pump the faucet handle, there is almost no functional way for the sinks to eat the money. &nbsp;Add to this the habit of many players to hoard ISK, and you have an ever increasing pool of money. &nbsp;CCP has to know this. &nbsp;They do have an economist on staff. &nbsp;So inflation is inevitable in this scenario, especially if the player base growth does not keep pace with the faucets. &nbsp;Steady, slow inflation is not bad. &nbsp;In fact, it is often seen as a sign of a healthy economy. &nbsp;But what happens when the players are not inflating things fast enough themselves, either through slow market shifts or player count growth?</div></div><div><br /></div><div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://grimmash.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/masterhand1.jpeg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://grimmash.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/masterhand1.jpeg" /></a></div><div style="clear: both; text-align: center;">Umm... Hi?</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>I doubt CCP wants to lower ISK faucet amounts. &nbsp;It creates a huge uproar every time. &nbsp;Look at the anomalies nerf. &nbsp;I'm not a null sec player and I heard that din. &nbsp;Nerfs make players angry. &nbsp;So the logical idea is to try and pump up the baseline values players consider normal. &nbsp;I would argue minerals are the final indicator of this, but others may disagree. &nbsp;Anyhow, looking at recent developments, I think CCP is trying to cautiously embrace the inflation.</div><div><br /></div><div>Higher mineral cost ships helps consume minerals as ships are destroyed, hopefully driving up scarcity on minerals. &nbsp;The Goons, oddly enough, are helping create scarcity on both ends with their recent activities in limiting mining. &nbsp;PI scarcity and POCO destruction all consume and constrain resources from POS fuel all the way up the production line to T3 components. &nbsp;You need a POS to do almost any useful research or invention in Eve.&nbsp;</div><div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://grimmash.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/PLEX-MArket1.jpeg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://grimmash.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/PLEX-MArket1.jpeg" /></a></div><div style="text-align: center;">Prices may change at any time.</div><div><br /></div><div>PLEX is the one outlier - In my opinion, CCP wants PLEX to stay cheap enough in game for players to keep buying it, and driving RMT sales of new PLEX outside the game. &nbsp;So CCP is trying to figure out how to increase relative costs of everything in the game except PLEX! &nbsp;Because the easiest account to close is the one you can no longer rely on getting "free". &nbsp;This explains the seemingly frequent PLEX sales of late. &nbsp;As PLEX continues to increase in game, CCP cannot afford to turn up the ISK faucets, but they want to keep moving PLEX so that the real bottom line stays healthy.</div>
