I set up all the planets for the <a href="http://69.89.31.225/~grimmash/2013/03/precocious-pod-dweller-planetary-puzzle.html?showComment=1362713954925#c4442520830137210436" target="_blank">challenge</a>, 3 barren, 2 lava, and have the production planet going. &nbsp;I also have a sheet set up to track the costs by line item. &nbsp;I loves me some Excel! &nbsp;Without further ado, here are the costs incurred in buying the command centers, setting up the planets (including a few mistakes in placing and rebuilding PI buildings), and transferring the first production loads from the resources planets to the production planet (also including one mistake):<br /><div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://grimmash.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/PI-Balancesheet-11.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://grimmash.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/PI-Balancesheet-11.png" /></a></div><br />The Customs Office interface is still horrible, and you can easily transfer crap back to a planet when you think you are loading it to your ship. &nbsp;Why? &nbsp;Because CCP decided that the CO inventory screen should not be part of the unified inventory. &nbsp;That's great. &nbsp;That cost me about $500k isk. &nbsp;Remember to open your ship inventory and drag the items from to CO to there, and not hit the Transfer button.<br /><br />The PI interface still leaves important info out of the equation when placing buildings. &nbsp;So if you click the wrong facility, you cannot check what it makes until after you spend the money on it once you are in that process. &nbsp;Yes, I could right click, show info, and then choose and place it. &nbsp;Perhaps the Build Panel could include a PX &gt; PY note right on the screen. &nbsp;So be careful if you are setting this stuff up.<br /><br />Accounting note: &nbsp;My production planet came online on Eve-day 3/8/13, so the challenge will run until I sell products made withing 30 days of 3/8/13.
