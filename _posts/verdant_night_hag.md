Today I present to you the Verdant Night Hag.  If you don't care why I made it, skip below!  

## Lore

This creature is a replacement for the default Nanny Pupu in Tomb of Annihilation.  In the base module she is a green hag.  If you dig into the DM's Guild content for ToA, you might find a very nice little module called [Ruins of Mbala](https://www.dmsguild.com/product/307856/Ruins-of-Mbala--maps-and-extra-content-for-Tomb-of-Annihilation#:~:text=High%20above%20the%20dense%20jungles,doctor%20with%20ancient%20magical%20powers.).  I think that module is lovely and it gives a richer backstory and framework to build out both Nanny Pupu and Eku the guide.  

I took the content in Ruins and decided Nanny was cast out from the Sewn Sisters, not wanting to follow her coven into servitude under Acererak, and made her way to Mbala.  After a time she slowly began converting into a green hag, as is the wont of hag ecology (*see Volo's Guide to Monsters p.57*).  But when the players meet her she is in a hybrid state between the two forms of hag-dom.  Instead of being a night hag or a green hag, Nanny is a Verdant Night hag.

Her transformation has retained and enhanced many of her powers of travel, illusions and charm.  She wants

> ***Magic Resistance.*** The hag has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
>
> ***Night Hag Items.*** A night hag carries two very rare magic items that she must craft for herself If either object is lost, the night hag will go to great lengths to retrieve it, as creating a new tool takes time and effort.
>
> *Heartstone:* This lustrous black gem allows a night hag to become ethereal while it is in her possession. The touch of a heartstone also cures any disease. Crafting a heartstone takes 30 days.
>
> *Soul Bag:* When an evil humanoid dies as a result of a night hag's Nightmare Haunting, the hag catches the soul in this black sack made of stitched flesh. A soul bag can hold only one evil soul at a time, and only the night hag who crafted the bag can catch a soul with it. Crafting a soul bag takes 7 days and a humanoid sacrifice (whose flesh is used to make the bag).

> ### Actions
> ***Multiattack.*** The hag makes two attacks, using Claw.
>
> ***Claws (Hag Form Only).*** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 13 (2d8 + 4) slashing damage.
>
> ***Change Shape.*** The hag magically polymorphs into a Small or Medium female humanoid, or back into her true form. Her statistics are the same in each form. Any equipment she is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. She reverts to her true form if she dies.
>
> ***Charm.*** The hag targets one humanoid it can see within 30 ft. of it. If the target can see the hag, the target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw against this magic or be charmed by the hag. The charmed target regards the hag as a trusted friend to be heeded and protected. Although the target isn't under the hag's control, it takes the hag's requests or actions in the most favorable way it can.
>
> Each time the hag or the hag's companions do anything harmful to the target, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. Otherwise, the effect lasts 24 hours or until the hag is destroyed, is on a different plane of existence than the target, or takes a bonus action to end the effect.
>
> ***Etherealness.*** The hag magically enters the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, or vice versa. To do so, the hag must have a heartstone in her possession.
>
> ***Illusory Appearance.*** The hag covers itself and anything it is wearing or carrying with a magical illusion that makes it look like another creature of its general size and shape. The effect ends if the hag takes a bonus action to end it or if it dies.
>
>The changes wrought by this effect fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, the hag could appear to have no claws, but someone touching its hand might feel the claws. Otherwise, a creature must take an action to visually inspect the illusion and succeed on a DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check to discern that the hag is disguised.
>
> ***Illusory Double.*** The hag creates an illusory duplicate of herself, which appears in its own space. As long as she can see her duplicate , the hag can move it a distance equal to her walking speed as well as make the illusion speak on her turn. The illusion has the same statistics as the hag but can't take actions or reactions. It can interact and hold objects, but disappears if it takes any damage. Otherwise, the illusion lasts until she dismisses it or can no longer see it.

>
> **Invisible Passage.** The hag magically turns invisible until she attacks or casts a spell, or until her concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell). While invisible, she leaves no physical evidence of her passage, so she can be tracked only by magic. Any equipment she wears or carries is invisible with her.
