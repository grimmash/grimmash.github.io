Results:<br /><div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://grimmash.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Day-81.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://grimmash.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Day-81.png" /></a></div><div style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Getting back on track. &nbsp;I made good on my promise of more, smaller trades. &nbsp;This is my third best day so far. &nbsp;To answer a question in previous comments, I'll elaborate on my strategies a little bit. &nbsp;I'm not going to tell which items I am working in, but the general approach I am using.</div><div style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="clear: both; text-align: left;">I tend to look for items that have at least 20% margin. &nbsp;The only things I break this rule for are some items that have very high turnover (500+ per day) and that will net me in the 1 mil range on turnover. &nbsp;There are a few reasons for this:</div><div style="clear: both; text-align: left;"></div><ul><li>High margins tend to burst after a short window, as someone undercuts to try and move items or, I assume, manipulate the market to their advantage.</li><li>Turnover, as listed in game, does not tell you if those are buy or sell orders. &nbsp;Nothing is fun like buying 50 items and realizing that the movement is all on the Buy Order side of the equation.</li><li>Many of the large price, large spread orders seem to have robots updating the buy orders. &nbsp;I can't say these are bots, but I am sorely tempted to get a stopwatch and log attempts to talk... &nbsp;I'm not bitter, at all.</li></ul><div>I also limit orders to some extent because of how long it takes to update when I start to get over 30-40 total buy and sell orders. &nbsp;Market trading is literally spreadsheets in space as no other action in the game I have yet undertaken.</div><br /><br />
