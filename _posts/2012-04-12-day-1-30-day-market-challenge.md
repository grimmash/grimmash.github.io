The results of my first day of the <a href="http://69.89.31.225/~grimmash/2012/04/12/borrowing-from-others-30-day-challenge/" target="_blank">30 Day Challenge</a>:<br /><div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://grimmash.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Day-11.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://grimmash.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Day-11.png" /></a></div><div style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Not bad for my first foray out. &nbsp;I bought two skills, Trade and Broker Relations. &nbsp;As far as modules, I am using a strategy of looking at volume and the margin between buy and sell orders in one station. &nbsp;The most challenging part of today's work was playing the .01 isk game. &nbsp;Some items are much more heavily contested, and also have nice margins. &nbsp;Those are for days when I have lots of time to look at the markets.&nbsp;</div><div style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="clear: both; text-align: left;">The biggest question is how to scale up from margins of 10k or a few 100k to something that is more profitable! &nbsp;A few more days to manage the income, and then I think I'll ahve to start looking at that question.</div><span></span><span></span>
