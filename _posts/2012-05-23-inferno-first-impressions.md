The Good<br /><br /><ul><li>The new missile launchers are very pretty. &nbsp;Staggering launchers is now really fun!</li><li>The Wardec screen is much more legible.</li><li>All the new screen revamps look pretty.</li><li>Most of the new SB models look nice.</li><li>Once you get used to it, looting no longer has the slight movement every time you get to a new wreck.</li></ul><div>The Bad</div><div><ul><li>Right clicking on a corp in the wardec screen only gives "Declare Mutual" and no option to "Show Info". &nbsp;That's frustrating.</li><li>It is now much harder to see into two "containers" at once, such as your ship's hold and a loot can. &nbsp;Grr. &nbsp;Shift clicking is an extra step. &nbsp;I didn't try it, heard it works, we'll see. &nbsp;It's still an extra step...</li><li>The new Tree structure on the Inventory eats screen real estate. &nbsp;This is challenging when you open, say, Inventory, Market and Wallet screens to manage market orders.</li><li>The Inventory takes longer to load. &nbsp;Not good.</li><li>The "ghosting" effect of text in the new inventory. &nbsp;It's harder to read.&nbsp;</li></ul><div>The Ugly</div></div><div><ul><li>The missile launchers on my Tengu. &nbsp;I would really like to see either larger wings with an over/under turret placement, or place them in a nice line on the slant of the hull. &nbsp;Right now it looks... wonky.</li><li>Drone Battleship explosions seem to be MIA.</li><li>Directional lighting for 3D models in the Market. &nbsp;Not bad, per se, but it's always been hard to really appreciate the ships with the dark lighting.</li></ul></div>
