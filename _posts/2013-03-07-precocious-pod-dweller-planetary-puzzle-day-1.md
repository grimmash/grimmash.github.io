As mentioned, I am giving <a href="http://mabricksmumblings.blogspot.com/2013/03/actual-noob-pi-income-data-and-offer.html" target="_blank">Mabrick's proposition</a> a shot. &nbsp;From the latest post, there a few things I am unsure of, namely, if his 500m isk/month claim was based in HS or WH space. &nbsp;But, here are the conditions of my experiment:<br /><div><ul><li>Skills: &nbsp;</li><ul><li>Command Center Upgrades 4&nbsp;</li><li>Interplanetary Consolidation 4&nbsp;</li><li>Planetology 2&nbsp;</li><li>Remote Sensing 3</li></ul><li>Production</li><ul><li>Final Product: Robotics</li></ul><li>Planets:</li><ul><li>2 Barren R0 &gt; P1</li><li>2 Lava R0 &gt; P1</li><li>1 Barren Production Planet P1 &gt; P3</li><li>All planets are in one High Sec system with standard Customs Office rates.</li></ul></ul>A few other notes. &nbsp;I am not taking up the challenge as presented mainly because I don't want to move the alt, and it has about 30m skill points. &nbsp;Those are almost entirely in mining, production, and recently combat.<br /><br /><div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://grimmash.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/PM-Skills-2-300x2361.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="252" src="http://grimmash.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/PM-Skills-2-300x2361-300x236.png" width="320" /></a></div>Here are the Planetary Management skills, IC 4 will be done soon:<br /><div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://grimmash.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/PM-Skills-300x1021.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="109" src="http://grimmash.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/PM-Skills-300x1021-300x102.png" width="320" /></a></div>Here are the planets, pending the production planet due to IC 4:<br /><div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://grimmash.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/PM-Planets-300x1121.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="120" src="http://grimmash.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/PM-Planets-300x1121-300x112.png" width="320" /></a></div>Here is the pattern used for all of the R0 &gt; P1 planets:<br /><div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://grimmash.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/PM-Layout-300x1851.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="198" src="http://grimmash.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/PM-Layout-300x1851-300x185.png" width="320" /></a></div>You'll notice that the extractors are much further from storage than Mabrick indicates. &nbsp;This is because HS planets have crap for resource distribution, so the R0 &gt; P1 chain is located central to the hotspots I judged to be closest together on each planet. &nbsp;Notice the bands I used on the scanner, to give you an idea of the resource density here:<br /><div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://grimmash.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/PM-Hotspots-300x1641.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="175" src="http://grimmash.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/PM-Hotspots-300x1641-300x164.png" width="320" /></a></div><br />Mabrick contends that something around 500m isk is viable each month. &nbsp;Many readers disagreed. &nbsp;Given my skills, I'll shoot for 50%-75% of his estimate. &nbsp;Thats 250m to 375m isk in one month. &nbsp;I'll start my timer from the day I get the production planet up and running. &nbsp;I am going to have ~2 days of P1 production already created by the time that happens, but given the nature of resource depletion, I'll use them and consider it to be a wash.<br /><br />Initial Costs:<br /><div><ul><li>Setup of 4 planets with level 5/6 Command Centers: $23,720,000.03.</li></ul></div></div>
