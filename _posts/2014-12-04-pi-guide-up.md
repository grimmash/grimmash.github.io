I finally pulled together something that has been posted by me in various places at various points and put it into my guides, now plural.  Behold, a <a title="Basic PI Extraction" href="http://grimmash.com/guides/basic-pi-extraction/">basic guide to PI extraction!</a>  It only covers the most effective way to get P1s and briefly talks about running those P1s into bigger PI chains.  You can click the link above, or use the nav bar to get there.  Enjoy!
