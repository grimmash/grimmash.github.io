Although it's another day for me, it's the same Eve day, so this goes into the first day, hence the Part II.<br /><br />I took the first batch of Robotics to market. &nbsp;111 units to be exact. &nbsp;I also removed some storage facilities and added some ECU Extractor heads on my low yield planets. &nbsp;I've adjusted the tracking sheet to account for a few more things. &nbsp;Here are the results from my labors:<br /><div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://grimmash.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/PI-Balance-1.21.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://grimmash.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/PI-Balance-1.21.png" /></a></div><br /><br />Back of the envelope calculations show this scheme, if static for the next 29 days, will yield the following:<br /><div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://grimmash.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Estimate1.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://grimmash.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Estimate1.png" /></a></div><div style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Hmm. &nbsp;We might have a problem here. At roughly 5/6 capacity of Mabrick's approach, we are looking at about 30% of his estimated income.</div><div style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="clear: both; text-align: left;">I found I could add a second production line on the factory planet, which accounts for the increase in Construction costs. &nbsp;But I am not sure high sec planets will be able to keep two robotics lines fed. &nbsp;The resource density on one of the planets is already starting to take a hit, and cannot feed 4 R0 &gt; P1 factories. &nbsp;That means I may not be able to keep even one robotics line running at full capacity.</div><div style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="clear: both; text-align: left;">For reference, one Robotics line running at capacity for one month will produce 2160 (24 hours * 3 units * 30 days), and two lines will produce 4320. &nbsp;At current Jita buy prices of 81,000 isk per unit of Robotics, before accounting for import and export taxes, that equates to roughly 175m to 350m isk in sales per month. &nbsp;Setting up sell orders increases the price by 1,000 isk per unit, giving 177m to 354m isk.</div><br />Perhaps selling extra materials on one end will make up the difference?
