Results:<br /><div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://grimmash.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Day-201.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://grimmash.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Day-201.png" /></a></div>Banner day! &nbsp;New record for margin, at 108m. &nbsp;That was nice. &nbsp;One cool thing about have more liquid isk is the ability to go in a buy up orders that are trying to push down the overall margin. &nbsp;You sacrifice some margin on a few items to keep your margin on the bulk of your goods. &nbsp;This gets you more isk. &nbsp;Win.<br /><br />Based on my success so far, and my lack of desire to spend any more time updating the same orders, I have begun training additional trade alts. &nbsp;The more observant readers of my blog may have noted that I currently run three accounts, roughly defined as Combat, Industrialist, and Trader/Corp/Blarg. &nbsp;This means I have 9 slots, and three can be up and running at any given time. &nbsp;The obvious next step to enhance profits is to have eyes, and orders, stationed in or near every trade hub so I can capitalize on arbitrage.<br /><br />For those who are unfamiliar, trading has a few flavors. &nbsp;Station trading is what I have been mainly involved in up till now. &nbsp;This consists of setting high buy orders and selling to low sell orders in the same station. &nbsp;But this approach is weak to those that have more power (read isk) than you, as they can manipulate markets and leave you with a pile of suddenly worthless inventory. &nbsp;Arbitrage is another method of trading, where you scout price disparities between regions and buy in one place, haul the goods to another place, and sell for profit.<br /><br />My tentative plan is to have eyes in Jita, Amarr, Rens and Dodixie, and perhaps train up a suitable hauler who can run between these, moving goods to the best location to sell in. &nbsp;At my current pace, one account in one station can pay for itself and have excess isk at the end of the month. &nbsp;I may be able to get two PLEXes if the pace keeps going. &nbsp;Four characters will have less profit per account due to time, but I imagine it will still manage to pay for multiple accounts.<br /><br />This plan will take some time to implement, however. &nbsp;Skills must be trained, and the isk must flow!
