<div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://grimmash.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/wormhole_1024.jpg" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://grimmash.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/wormhole_1024.jpg" height="199" width="320" /></a></div>After wrapping up affairs in Black Rise, selling off a lot of assets,  and moving others, I am ready for my next step in Eve.&nbsp; I am moving  into a wormhole.&nbsp; Or I should say I have already moved into a wormhole.&nbsp;  I moved in earlier in the week. This is pretty exciting, and I hope a  good number of the tricks and skills I learned in FW will come in  useful.&nbsp; At least I know how to use the directional scanner!<br /><br />About one week in, I am reminded of this quote:<br /><blockquote><blockquote><div style="-webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 21px; margin: 0.5em 0px; orphans: auto; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px;">Reports  that say there's -- that something hasn't happened are always  interesting to me, because as we know, there are known knowns; there are  things that we know that we know. We also know there are known  unknowns; that is to say we know there are some things we do not know.  But there are also unknown unknowns, the ones we don't know we don't  know.</div><div style="-webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 21px; margin-top: 0px; orphans: auto; padding-left: 1.6em; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px;">â€”Donald Rumsfeld, United States Secretary of Defense</div></blockquote></blockquote>You  might not like Donald Rumsfeld, but that is not the point of the  quote.&nbsp; The point is that you never realize the third category of  unknown unknowns until it decloaks one top of you, points you, and blows  you up.&nbsp; Or you realize that all of your supplies are suddenly  unavailable due to corporate mechanics and a mis-click. <br /><br />Lots  of things have changed.&nbsp; Moving from stations to POS towers, removing  local chat, and suddenly having no idea what might be in the next system  over, are now my day to day life in Eve.&nbsp; I have never spent so much  time accomplishing nothing but learning so much about how Eve works as I  have in the last few days.&nbsp; My skill queue has found new and  interesting nooks and crannies to fill out.&nbsp; Previously mysterious parts  of the interface have become a new home.&nbsp; And paranoia has hit a whole  new level.
