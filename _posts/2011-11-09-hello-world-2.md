Good morning, evening or whatever time it where you are at!<br /><br /><i>Who am I?</i><br /><br />Someone who likes to play Eve Online and obsess over various minutiae of games design and gameplay. &nbsp;I've been dabbling in high sec and low sec for the last year across a variety of characters, and have messed about in missions, trade, industry, wormholes and some (usually unsuccessful) pvp.<br /><br /><i>Why should you read what I write?</i><br /><br />I have no idea why any of us read about fictional, digital worlds that we spend time interacting, so you tell me.<br /><br /><i>How often am I going to update this thing?</i><br /><br />Hopefully once a week or more. &nbsp;My goal is to write in two main areas: Commentary and Education. &nbsp;I like talking about internet spaceships, and I hope to make learning how to play internet spaceships a little easier for others.<br /><br />Well I think that covers relevant introductory things. &nbsp;Fly safe, or barring that, fly fun!
