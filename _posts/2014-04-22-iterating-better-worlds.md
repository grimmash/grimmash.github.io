<br /><div><a href="http://grimmash.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/operative.jpg" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://grimmash.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/operative.jpg" height="240" width="320" /></a>First, a minor point before I get started.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The dev blog “Building Better Worlds” could have lifted the<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> quote </span>either from the Weiland Yutani Corporation logo from the Alien mythos, or the Operative from Serenity. &nbsp;In that movie the line is uttered by a character who believes he is helping create better worlds, but then finds out that his whole ideology was based on a naïve understanding of what his superiors were actually doing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I hope that was not what CCP was implying with the title…</div>title from a few places.<br /><div><br /></div><div>Ok, that out of the way, let’s get into it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>After thinking and reading about the new industry changes that are coming I think there are a few sides to the topic that have not been talked about all that much.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>It all boils down to getting new players while holding on to the old ones.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>That is, after all, CCP’s business model.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Access</strong></div><div><br /></div><div>First, we don’t know exactly what the new cost will be for the new slot-less industry design.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>We know the range (0%-14%) and we know it is based on the price of the finished good (derived from the rolling average?).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>But we do not know the break points, or exactly how it will play out.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I am sure smarter players than I can tell you more about this, but I’m not overly concerned.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The spreadsheet wizards will always find a way to win at Eve, and the casuals will probably have some rude learning experiences.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Nothing new to see here.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>But one thing the new slot-less system will do, regardless of pricing, is provide a fast, immediate way in for anyone.</div><div><br /></div><div>This is really important.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>If you cannot remember what being a new player in industry is like, let me tell you.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>You learn about Research and Manufacturing, and maybe get a few BPOs to test things out.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>You look around High Sec and realize that any stations worth using are either insanely expensive, full for a month, or both.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>You start looking at what it takes to get out to Low Sec and the open research slots there.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>If you are really smart, you realize you out to be using a tech two ship to move your goods to avoid losing your assets.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>You then realize that training for those safer ships, for a new pilot, is not insignificant.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The training will take weeks or months.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>So you have two options.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Either wait for weeks to even start your jobs, or wait for weeks to safely engage in Low Sec.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Both of those options are terrible.</div><div><br /></div><div>If CCP wants people to engage in industry, it needs to be accessible.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>There needs to be an obvious, easy way to at least get started.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The new changes provide this. Any newbie will be able to create an account, train Research to I, and get down to getting down.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Sure, it may be a bit more expensive, and sure it may not be the long term way towards industry in Eve, but it is a start.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I can also think of no other part of the game that is as prohibitive from day one as industry right now.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>You can run missions, mine, explore, haul, or get into PvP within hours or days of starting an account.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Again, you will not be doing well at these tasks, and you won’t be using the same ships or strategies in a month or a year, but you can start!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>This change lets newbies start exploring industry in the same way as in any other part of the game.</div><div><br /></div><div>Think of a bike with training wheels.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Yeah, the training wheels suck, but many people need them to get started.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Once you get a feel for the bike, you throw the training wheels away.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>In a lot of ways Hish Sec space is the training wheel of Eve.</div><div><br /></div><div><strong>Null Sec is Best Sec?</strong></div><div><br /></div><div>Second, the argument that this new system will push industry players to null sec decries pushing players into a specific style of Eve.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Sure, that seems like a logical conclusion, but maybe it is not so bad.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Currently the tinfoil prognosticators say that a very small fraction of players actually live in Null.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I’ll go with that.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>But take a look at who has stuck around in Eve for the long haul.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The list mostly consists of Null sec players, Low sec pirates, FW players, and Wormhole residents.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>There are some high sec players that have been around a while, but I would wager the age of those accounts is a bit lower, and a fair number of those accounts are second or third accounts of people living outside high sec on the main account.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Go take a look at the blogs and Twitter.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The space famous people who both help create content and help create the community.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>They tend to live in places that are not Empire Space.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>There may be a good reason to push people out into the edges of Eve.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>That is where they really start to engage with each other. </div><div><br /></div><div>CCP has to keep players interested in the game.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>High Sec is not the place to keep people.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>It gets boring and dull.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>About the only exciting way to live in High Sec is to either do industry or play markets.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Neither of these, by themselves, provides a whole lot of excitement.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Other players provide that.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>CCP seems to be tweaking the game to push more people out of the middle.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>FW got a revamp.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>WH space can provide lucrative rewards.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Null has better isk if you know what to do, and it has all those big fights, and all those really big ships.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Gently prodding High Sec players to move out and explore other options helps them learn the game and build the connections that will keep subs coming in, and keep the player driven plotlines going.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span></div><div><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"><br /></span></div><div><strong>Seagull Space</strong></div><div><br /></div><div>Third, there is the future.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Null sec is kind of broken, or at least sov is.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>If CCP Seagull’s “new space” is any indication, CCP is more interested in trying something new rather than just burning the whole world down.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Imagine sitting in CCP’s shoes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>You have a core of hardcore long term players that live in the sov of now.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Those players run or play in the player organizations that tend to keep people playing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>You know that sov is spiraling into irrelevance or stagnation for long stretches.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>But if you tear down that whole system and replace it on a patch day, you may lose a whole bunch of people who worked really hard to get where they are in the broken system, and who have been paying good money or buying the PLEX that others paid good money for.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Remember, someone paid for every PLEX in the game.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Even if you make enough isk to not pay real money for Eve, someone else is paying that price.</div><div><br /></div><div>Instead of tearing apart the sov system these players have played in for so long, you could start laying the ground for a new system.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>You start trying to implement the little things that will make it work.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>At the same time you continue trying to herd players into the regions and player organizations that will adapt to major change and create the community connections that keep online games going.</div><div><br /></div><div>You do all these little things, and then when the big day comes and you open a new space, you have all the little pieces in place.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>You also have the safe haven for the invested players.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>You have new opportunities for new and old players.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>And you have a live test bed for a long term solution to the old space too.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Let players do as they will for a few months or an expansion cycle.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Then CCP can come back and say “See how well this new thing worked?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Well, we are going to implement that in the old world too.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Or CCP can say “See how this new thing almost worked, but didn’t?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>We’re going to fix it and not touch the old world.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The process can continue until you get the desired result.</div><div><br /></div><div>At least, that’s what I hope is going on.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I suppose we shall see soon enough, as the dev blogs and Fanfest approach.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I do wish that CCP would be a bit more open about their plans.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>That might provide a light at the end of the tunnel for players who see many of the new changes as an attack on their way of playing Eve.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I wonder how many people would respond favorably to an announcement like this:</div><div><br /></div><div><em>“Many parts of New Eden are old.</em><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"><em>&nbsp; </em></span><em>The players, the game, and CCP have outgrown what currently exists.</em><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"><em>&nbsp; </em></span><em>This is not a simple problem to fix.</em><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"><em>&nbsp; </em></span><em>There is entrenched code and there are entrenched interests.</em><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"><em>&nbsp; </em></span><em>We want to build a better world, but to do so will take time and effort, and there will be growing pains.</em><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"><em>&nbsp; </em></span></div><div><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"><em><br /></em></span></div><em> </em><div><em>Our plan is to release a new cluster, linked to New Eden, but operating with different rules that govern how players interact with the universe.</em><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"><em>&nbsp; </em></span><em>In this new cluster we will pioneer that better world while providing a space for new and old players to explore, build, fight and destroy.</em><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"><em>&nbsp; </em></span><em>We’ll take the opportunity to find solutions that work for all of Eve Online.</em><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"><em>&nbsp; </em></span><em>By creating new space, we can preserve what players have accomplished in the New Eden Cluster, and provide ample time and space for creating new gameplay mechanics without completely changing the game you know and love overnight.</em><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"><em>&nbsp; </em></span><em>We invite you to continue flying with us as we continue to expand and refine both New Eden and the universe beyond.”</em></div><br /><br />I would welcome something along those lines.
