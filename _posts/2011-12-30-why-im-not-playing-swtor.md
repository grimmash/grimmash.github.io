I'd been thinking about it, but fears of WoW-creep have lingered. &nbsp;I spent about 5 years in WoW, I'm not going back. &nbsp;There are some features of a character driven MMO that are appealing in a way that Internet Spaceships is not. &nbsp;Incarna was a botched attempt at this, but does show that having an avatar is something many players want. &nbsp;I loved gearing up my Hunter, but got frustrated with the constant "gear resets" that each patch added. &nbsp;So deep in the recesses of my brain, I have been hoping for SW:TOR to swoop in, beloved droids bee-booping and lightsabers flashing and sweep me off my feet.<br /><br />Then <a href="http://poeticstanziel.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Poetic</a> posted a link to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44lXiU9MEGg" target="_blank">this</a>. &nbsp;Images of dancing in Orgrimmar waiting for Raid/BG/Dungeon/Something to Grind flooded into my brain. &nbsp;And the interface looks... identical?<br /><br />No thanks.
