Results:<br /><div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://grimmash.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Day-291.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://grimmash.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Day-291.png" /></a></div>I had my last final today, so not much happened. &nbsp;Tomorrow is wide open though, so I am hoping for a strong finish! &nbsp;Aside from my busy day, not much to report. &nbsp;Mostly trading in weapons and various mid slot modules lately. &nbsp;I did nothing special, just flipped a lot of orders while on campus. &nbsp;The final write up / guide is also underway. &nbsp;Expect that in the next few days.
