</span>You would be right.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I even went so far as to pre-order Reaper of Souls, because D3 is scratching a mindless kill-fest itch I have been having lately.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Since I’ve put a good chunk of time in over the last week, I decided I might as well give a snapshot review of D3 with Loot 2.0, as a bit of a baseline for when I play the expansion.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div>For the record, I started playing Loot 2.0 with a 60 Barbarian with no Paragon levels, leveled a Wizard from about 20 to 31, and started a Witch Doctor up to about 10.</div><h4 style="text-align: center;"><b><span style="font-weight: normal;">The Good</span></b></h4><h4><span style="font-weight: normal;">Loot</span></h4><div>The biggest part of the patch/update/whatever was, by and large, a success.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>On non-60 characters, the drops are wonderfully improved.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Items get replaced left and right.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Crafting yields lots of appropriate gear.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I never had the moment of thinking “I really need to check the Auction House”, which was a relief, considering that was half of every play session last time around.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>On my 60, drops were ok.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>And by I ok, I do mean a damn sight better than before.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>But good drops are harder to come by.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I think I replaced almost everything except my weapons.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>There is probably some sort of RNG curve going on here.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>But I was also limited to Hard mode.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>More on that in a bit.</div><h4><span style="font-weight: normal;">Difficulty Levels</span></h4><div>You can change the difficulty on the fly, instead of starting a whole new campaign.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>This is great, but there was one problem, which I will talk about later.</div><h4><span style="font-weight: normal;">Pacing</span></h4><div>The speed with which I am gaining levels and paragon levels is, if anything, a little fast.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I gained some 16 paragon levels on my Barbarian, and that is primarily solo, burning through hard mode from mid Act 1 to the beginning of Act III.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>For the other classes, I cannot really say much, as the Barbarian is the only character above level 31 I have at this point.</div><div>So far the new Paragon system seems interesting, although I am not a huge fan of the gating of points.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>You get a rotation of Core, Offense, Defense and Utility points, in that order, as you gain levels.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>This is rather frustrating.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I would have rather seen the ability to assign freely amongst all the areas, as it seems like this just slows down tweaking to take advantage of certain builds.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Nonetheless, the new system provides a welcome ability to customize the characters you build in some small way.</div><h4 style="text-align: center;"><b><span style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">The Bad</span></span></b></h4><h4><span style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">Difficulty</span></span></h4><div>I can select any difficulty level in game, as long as it is easy, medium or hard.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I cannot choose the higher levels without backing out and restarting from the most recent checkpoint.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>This is annoying because “Hard” mode isn’t hard.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>At all.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I actually tweaked my Whirlwind Barb into a Seismic Slam build to slow down the fights and force myself to think about positioning.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>On my Wizard, leveling is a joke.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The real limiting factor is often clumping enemies together become unleashing AOE, and then the time it takes to get to the next pack.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I just fought Belial on Hard with the 60 Barbarian.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I never moved once, and I think my health meter blipped off full maybe twice.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I really hope the increased difficulty levels change that.</div><div>Also, aside from a semantic change in the naming of difficulty levels, I am not sure I see what the big difference is.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Each character has to go through the game at least once to unlock all the <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><h4><span style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">Gems</span></span></h4><div>Gems are pretty boring.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The stat boosts they give are very small unless they are percentage based, which does not happen very often.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Any given class really only needs to use 3 of the 5 gem types: Diamonds for resist-all, red for % life, and then whatever your stat is.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I hope Reaper of Souls brings in some sort of Rune system, or even the socketing system from WoW, where combinations give additional bonuses or something to make it more interesting. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>Hell, steal the Torchlight gems.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Those were fun and had a lot of variety.</div><div>I also assume Reaper will add more tiers of gems, because gems give 30-50 stat points while items generally drop, for me, with 200-300 stat points per property.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>There are almost no situations where a stat is worth trading for a stat property.</div><h4><span style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">NPCs</span></span></h4><div>The game still has lots of moments where you have to stop, wait for someone to say something, and then wait for an animation, and then wait for something else.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>By the time you get through to the door or get to fight the boss, that nifty buff you got melted away.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>While by no means crucial, it would be nice to not constantly get buffs that get eaten by plot points.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Which brings up…</div><h4><span style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">The Plot</span></span></h4><div>Replaying a turbo-tour of Acts I-II has reminded me of how silly and disjointed the plot in this game is.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>It really makes no sense.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The reveal of Tyreal and Belial both play very poorly after the first time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I am looking forward to Act III, which is such a strong set piece, but I think Act IV is going to be a drag.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Once adventure mode is live I wonder if anyone will be playing Act IV at all.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Hopefully RoS divests the talky-talky and lets our blades, spells, and jars of spiders do all the exposition.</div><h4><span style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">Atmosphere</span></span></h4><div>Diablo took place in an ever descending cathedral of madness.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>It was dark, dank, claustrophobic and oppressive.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The light radius mechanic had a huge impact on this.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Diablo II was a bit more open, relying on the more massive nature (literally or figuratively) of many foes to impart a sense of dread.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Diablo III feels rather barren.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The art is well done, but there is n o sense of lurking doom.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I think a huge part of this comes from the removal of the light radius mechanic.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>You can always kind of see around the corner, or to the edge of the screen.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>In future iterations I would love to see the light radius come back, along with the oppressive black pool surrounding the character.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Having to rely on the harsh lines of the minimap, or even better, your memory, <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>made the journey feel more isolated and more likely to result in a horrible end.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I recall moments of actual fear in Diablo.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>It would be nice to feel some of that again.</div><h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">The Ugly</span></span></h4><h4><span style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">Skills</span></span></h4><div>Two big issues still bug me about D3:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The way skills are selected and the normal and elective settings.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>To keep things simple, I’ll refer you to <a href="http://grimmash.com/2014/03/10/trees-vs-choices/">this post</a> regarding the skills system overall.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>No need to rehash that topic.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The second issue is in the very gamey way you can choose active skills.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>By default you have six skill slots on the hotbar, and can only choose one skill from each of six categories to fill those.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>If you dig into the options menus you can enable “elective” mode, which lets you choose any skill in any slot.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The implication seems to be that the proper way to play is with one skill from each of the six categories.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>You can go elsewhere and find many of the most recommended builds ignore this completely.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>If Diablo 3 was played with a gamepad, this system might have made sense.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div>But Diablo 3 is not played with a gamepad, and many skills require you to aim with your mouse.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Leap, ranged spells, and things like that obviously were built for mouse and keyboard.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>In this context, the limited skills seem like a cop-out to make balancing the game easier as opposed to providing some deeper gameplay mechanic.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The first two Diablo titles did not have this issue, nor does the Torchlight series.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The grouping of the skills doesn’t always seem to make much sense.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>All in all it is an ugly implementation that I can’t say I like much.</div><div>The rune system is still present, although a tremendous number of runes have been changed or reworked.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>However, the pacing of when runes unlock leads to a lot of static builds through leveling.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>On the Wizard in particular it seems like Ice is the only build you can really piece together due to the massive number of skills, passive abilities and runes you unlock that improve Ice compared to Fire or Arcane builds.</div><div>I mentioned this in my previous article, but the current system implies that the systems in previous Diablo games were too complicated.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The changes to talents in World of Warcraft seem to support this.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>If sales numbers can be used as proof people understanding the skill/talent system, I don’t think anyone was having much of problem getting the hang of either game series.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span></div><h4><span style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">Ghost Features</span></span></h4><div>I know this is a pre-expansion release.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>But it really bugs me that many of the new features are present but un-selectable in the menus.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>It would have been nice to have the tooltip at least recognize if you preordered the expansion.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>There are also a fair number of Crusader items dropping, which seems like somebody copied the wrong loot algorithm and table to the server a few weeks early.</div><h4><span style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">Pathing</span></span></h4><div>Why do the merchant’s belongings’ boxes always mess up my path in Acts I and III?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Why do I always get stuck on little parts of terrain?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Why can I lead to this platform, but not that one, or for that matter execute a random half leap for no apparent reason?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>None of these are game breaking, but they are annoying.</div><h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">Final Verdict</span></span></h4><div>You may think from this article that I don’t like Diablo III.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The answer is a bit complicated.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I’ve been playing it a fair amount.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I think the game has nice art direction, has the ability to create really fun moments once abilities start to unlock, and allow for nifty combinations of attacks and managing enemies. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>Loot 2.0 fixes some of the most egregious faults in the game.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>That point is important.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I stopped playing the first time because the whole game had become a gold grind for the Auction House.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Removal of the Auction House, one of the most touted features of the game, shows a huge change in direction for Blizzard, and shows that they still have some ability to push back against the avarice of the Koticks of the world, and their corporate structure.</div><div>However the core design choices with the skill and stats system and the rather odd writing outside Act III really hold the game back.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>This somehow becomes more apparent with the Auction House removed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The skill system, while allowing for a lot of combinations (Elective mode likely provides thousands or millions of permutations of skills, runes, and passives), still feels very empty, at least compared to previous entries and competition on the market.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The writing is less memorable than anything else Blizzard has turned out.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The atmosphere has none of the visceral oppression and dread from previous games.</div><div>Diablo 3 is polished.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The systems that are in place (as opposed to my ideal Diablo III) are well implemented aside from the aforementioned Leaping issues.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The sound and music are well done.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The graphics live up to Blizzard’s fit-the-bell-curve approach to such things.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>If this offering was the first Diablo game, I think it would have set a nice bar.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>But as a sequel, I think too much of the past was cast off in the name of marketing and the false idea that the game needed to be more accessible.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Perhaps unreasonable expectations prevent me from really letting the Prime Evils sink their hooks again.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Diablo III, especially with Loot 2.0, is good.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>But I still think it could have been great.</div>
