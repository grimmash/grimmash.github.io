<br /><div>I was meaning to write an article about opportunity cost that was much more eloquent than this will be, but the recent PI changes are great illustration I want to take advantage of.&nbsp; Also, robo-poster Jester beat me to some of the economics in&nbsp;<a href="http://jestertrek.blogspot.com/2011/12/doubled.html" target="_blank">this post</a>.</div><div><o:p></o:p></div><div><br /></div><div>So here is the second half.&nbsp; The TL;DR: I’m out (of PI)!<o:p></o:p></div><div><br /></div><div>Here is why.&nbsp; I have roughly 24 hours in each day.&nbsp; In those hours I have to eat, sleep, take care of my loved ones, attend school and work.&nbsp; Eve usually comes last in that progression, or is something I do in the background while I focus on one of the others.&nbsp; This is where opportunity cost comes in.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></div><div><br /></div><div>I am a high-sec carebear, mainly because it is a nice place to base out of and accomplish things in Eve while still being able to get up out of my chair if real life calls.&nbsp; I generally do not have time to scout low sec routes for gate camps, I generally do not have the mental desire to play hours of stations games, and I cannot commit to being available for CTAs or to wake up at 2am for a reinforcement timer.&nbsp; And here is where the opportunity costs of the PI changes come in.<o:p></o:p></div><div><br /></div><div>I assume that CCP wants to move more players out into low/null sec.&nbsp; That is the only sensible reason I can find for changing PI tax rates and POCOs.&nbsp; I suppose the idea is volume would make up for increased cost.&nbsp; But the cost of moving operations to low sec is far higher than just the isk.&nbsp; It is the time needed to scout, it is the cost of interrupted production if a POCO goes up in smoke, it is the cost of gate camps and pirates, and it is the time cost of training ships that can compete with the faction/tech II paradise that is low sec.&nbsp; Another factor is the mind-numbing amount of clicking that it takes to actually do PI.&nbsp; I don’t feel like setting up another 20 planets…&nbsp; PI (at current prices) in no way justifies these increases in time and isk spent for the rewards I get, given the recent changes.<o:p></o:p></div><div><br /></div><div>I assume CCP knows that PI production will fall in high sec.&nbsp; This will drive up POS fuel costs and thereby drive up much of the cost of all Tech II/III goods in the game.&nbsp;&nbsp; While this may be a good way to make low and null sec fights more meaningful, I find it a rather ham-fisted way to do so.&nbsp; The reason is that the opportunity costs are being placed on the player base that does not go to low or null sec, and probably does not want to.&nbsp; Asking the carebear/casual player base to change to a more time intensive playstyle in order to continue an established playstle is risky.&nbsp; Many of us stay in high sec because we do not have the time or energy needed to move further afield.<o:p></o:p><br /><br />To those that say this affects everyone, well, I have a feeling the null sec alliances will have low tax POCOs up and running fairly soon. &nbsp;I also doubt we will see many people putting up multi-million isk pinatas in low sec.</div><div><br /></div><div>If CCP wants high sec players to move to low sec or null sec, the key is to provide incentives or modify the game to fit the players, not restrict existing content and force players to modify themselves to fit the game.&nbsp; All these PI changes will do for me is reduce the amount of the game I partake in.<o:p></o:p></div><div><br /></div><div><i>As an aside: I have seen some comments relating to the idea that this mirrors the costs of production in the real world.&nbsp; These comments do not seem to realize that the difference between China and the USA is not one of law v. lawlessness, but sovereign bodies competing.&nbsp; Both have laws, they are just different.&nbsp; The more apt comparison would be Germany (high sec) v. Afghanistan (low sec).&nbsp; In one there are laws, and in the other, law often is who has the bigger gun and is willing to use it. &nbsp;I also apologize in advance if those comparisons are offensive. &nbsp;They are the first that came to mind.</i><o:p></o:p></div>
