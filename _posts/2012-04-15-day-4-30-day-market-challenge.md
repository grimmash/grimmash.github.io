Results:<br /><div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://grimmash.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Day-41.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://grimmash.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Day-41.png" /></a></div>Good day, inventory is almost nil, orders moved around nicely later in the day. &nbsp;I had to unload some items due to annoying price swings, so I spun the wheels in place a few times, but overall things are looking good and my range of modules is starting to spread out a bit. &nbsp;We'll see if I can keep this level up. &nbsp;So far I &nbsp;have been roughly doubling my isk, after the first day.<br /><br />As a side note, at this point I am beating <a href="http://guidetoeveonline.blogspot.com/2011/11/day-4-mission-day.html" target="_blank">Beamer</a>&nbsp;$94 mil to $6.6 mil. &nbsp;I wish he was around so we could compare notes...<br /><br />(Update: Beamer started with $473.47 isk, so that last comment may not have been fair.)
