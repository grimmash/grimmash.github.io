Results:<br /><div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://grimmash.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Day-131.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://grimmash.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Day-131.png" /></a></div>I broke $300,000,000! &nbsp;Hooray! &nbsp;I was really hoping to get past the 300m mark today, and I did it. &nbsp;And boy did the market get busy today. &nbsp;Patch brings more people to the game I guess. &nbsp;A few notes on the day:<br /><br /><ul><li>You can't see it, but I dropped about 8m on skills today, so the real total would have been 309m, but such is life.</li><li>Faction modules are on the market. &nbsp;I put in some dummy orders to maybe catch some people unawares. &nbsp;We'll see if that ever pans out.</li><li>At my current rate, I should be able to afford a PLEX, but I imagine we are in for some market volatility soon (tm), so that remains to be seen.</li></ul>The net change percent was low today, compared to yesterday, but the actual change was my third best day. &nbsp; I'm also running out of order slots, with Retail 3. &nbsp;That is going to be upgraded once I finish some Accounting training to lower the loss to Sales Tax. &nbsp;Yes, it's fractions of a percent, but as my volume of isk traded goes up, those percents make a difference at corner cases for margin. &nbsp;At some point I may also have to consider standings.<br /><br />Finally, I have only been station trading so far. &nbsp;In a few days I may be able to start training for distance. &nbsp;That will present a new sets of questions and challenges.
