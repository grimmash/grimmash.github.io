More results for you:<br /><br /><div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://grimmash.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Balance-Day-181.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://grimmash.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Balance-Day-181.png" /></a></div>Up from 36m isk in profits to 72m isk. &nbsp;The daily average profit is now at 3.6m/ day, or an end estimate of 108m isk, in profit. &nbsp;Interestingly there is a side to this that I have not spoken of: &nbsp;What you will profit not including the initial costs. &nbsp;Since my initial outlay of about 33m isk, my daily costs have hovered around 1.5m, and my total sales are at 133m. &nbsp;That means the profit only including day-to day costs is 106m, or 5.9m isk per day. &nbsp;That gives a final profit, less sunk costs, of an estimated 177m isk.<br /><br />So month one may be a bit of a bust, but subsequent months will be more profitable, by a considerable amount. &nbsp;I'm interested to see how this plays out.<br /><br />I also moved a lot of ECUs around today to combat depletion, which cost 315k isk.
