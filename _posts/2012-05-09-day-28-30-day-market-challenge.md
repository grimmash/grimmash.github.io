Results:<br /><div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://grimmash.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Day-281.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://grimmash.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Day-281.png" /></a></div>PLEX was purchased and redeemed today, so I am adding this cost in to the total to keep the numbers making sense. &nbsp;A 485 mil loss would seem a bit substantial, no? &nbsp;Aside from that, new record day with 172 mil in profits! &nbsp;My return to Jita appears to have been a good idea. &nbsp;This goes back to the point of turnover. <br /><br />Margins in Jita are not as good as many other trade hubs but the goods move! &nbsp;I only had about half of my usual order slots going as I ramped up in Jita again, and I still crushed it compared to Amarr or Dodixie. &nbsp;Being able to choose from all the weapon types is a huge boon.<br /><br />At this point I don't really care if my margins increase in actual dollar amounts. &nbsp;If I can maintain roughly 100 mil margin a day I can easily PLEX two of my three accounts and still be building wealth. &nbsp;If I can keep up the 150 m mark, then I will never even have to use profits from other account to pay for the game and fund ships. &nbsp;I also just got a job! &nbsp;So for the summer at least, I can keep chugging away on the market alt and in a few months buy that strategic cruiser I am training my industrialist into. &nbsp;In another 40 days, I can probably afford the whole thing through the market alt, and still be PLEX my game time.
