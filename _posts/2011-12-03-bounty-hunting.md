If you have read some of my previous posts, I would understand if you think I view pirates as the scum of Eve and they should all go die in that fire people talk about. &nbsp;But this is not true! &nbsp;I do want them dead, but by the hands of other players! &nbsp;I have spent some time thinking about the mechanics of sec status and piracy, and I have a proposal. Tweak the boundaries of legal pvp in eve. &nbsp;Here is a brief, chart based explanation:<br /><br />          <br /><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse: collapse; width: 314px;"><!--StartFragment--> <colgroup><col style="width: 65pt;" width="65"></col> <col style="mso-width-alt: 4992; mso-width-source: userset; width: 117pt;" width="117"></col> <col style="mso-width-alt: 5632; mso-width-source: userset; width: 132pt;" width="132"></col> </colgroup><tbody><tr height="15" style="height: 15.0pt;">  <td height="15" style="height: 15.0pt; width: 65pt;" width="65"></td>  <td style="width: 117pt;" width="117">System Security Status</td>  <td style="border-left: none; width: 132pt;" width="132">Legal Target   Sec Status*</td> </tr><tr height="15" style="height: 15.0pt;">  <td height="90" rowspan="6" style="height: 90.0pt;">High Sec</td>  <td style="border-left: none; border-top: none;">1</td>  <td style="border-left: none; border-top: none;">&lt;0.0</td> </tr><tr height="15" style="height: 15.0pt;">  <td height="15" style="border-left: none; border-top: none; height: 15.0pt;">0.9</td>  <td style="border-left: none; border-top: none;">-0.5</td> </tr><tr height="15" style="height: 15.0pt;">  <td height="15" style="border-left: none; border-top: none; height: 15.0pt;">0.8</td>  <td style="border-left: none; border-top: none;">-1.0</td> </tr><tr height="15" style="height: 15.0pt;">  <td height="15" style="border-left: none; border-top: none; height: 15.0pt;">0.7</td>  <td style="border-left: none; border-top: none;">-2.0</td> </tr><tr height="15" style="height: 15.0pt;">  <td height="15" style="border-left: none; border-top: none; height: 15.0pt;">0.6</td>  <td style="border-left: none; border-top: none;">-3.0</td> </tr><tr height="15" style="height: 15.0pt;">  <td height="15" style="border-left: none; border-top: none; height: 15.0pt;">0.5</td>  <td style="border-left: none; border-top: none;">-4.0</td> </tr><tr height="15" style="height: 15.0pt;">  <td height="15" style="border-top: none; height: 15.0pt;">Low Sec</td>  <td style="border-left: none; border-top: none;">0.4 to 0.1</td>  <td style="border-left: none; border-top: none;">-5.0</td> </tr><tr height="15" style="height: 15.0pt;">  <td height="15" style="border-top: none; height: 15.0pt;">Null Sec</td>  <td style="border-left: none; border-top: none;">Null/WH</td>  <td style="border-left: none; border-top: none;">All</td> </tr><!--EndFragment--></tbody></table><br /><br />Of course there are caveats.<br /><br /><ul><li>Any pilot with a negative sec status is a legal target according to the chart above.</li><li>Only players who have participated in an illegal action can be given a bounty.</li><li>Legal actions are any hostilities under the auspice of a war dec, taken after another player initiated hostilities in sec of 0.1 or greater, or anything occurring in low sec.</li><li>Non-sanctioned bounties (i.e. pirate bounties ) can be placed as contracts in null sec.</li><li>If a player has a legal bounty, he is a legal target in all sec statuses until podded. &nbsp;Once this occurs, his legal status reverts to the chart above.</li><li>Causing initial aggression (legally or illegally) invalidates insurance if a ship is lost during the ensuing aggression timer.</li><li>If a player has a bounty active, insurance does not pay out on losses.</li></ul><div><br /></div><div>The whole point of this is to increase the motive for players to actively hunt pirates, and to help make the sec from 1.0 to 0.5 more of a slope. &nbsp;Right now the incentive is mostly pride and possibly loot drops. &nbsp;This system tries to change the rules of engagement a little, and provide more of a career for Bounty Hunters. &nbsp;If you wanted to really push the system, you could add a map option that gave time delayed heat maps of systems with bounty targets. &nbsp;I mean, the gates know who is going where, right?</div><div><br /></div><div>Observers might also notice that this system does make it theoretically harder for Pirates to get to higher sec systems. &nbsp;This would maybe require some tweaking of system sec status, belt deposits and agent distribution, I have no idea. &nbsp;The point would be that along with risk/reward for carebears, pirates would also have a risk reward for coming after high sec targets.</div><div><br /></div><div>There are definitely some holes in this, but I would love to see anti-piracy become a viable career in Eve. &nbsp;If a valid implementation could be found for the bounty system, it could also lead to new stations, factions, ships and mechanics. &nbsp;Most importantly it would incentivize some high-sec residents to both place bounties and hunt for them (possibly leaving high sec!), creating more player-driven content in Eve.</div>
