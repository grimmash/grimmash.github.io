Results:<br /><div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://grimmash.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Day-121.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://grimmash.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Day-121.png" /></a></div>So that's a good day. &nbsp;My best overall margin so far. &nbsp;Nothing special happened, except I left Jita and went to another major hub. &nbsp;Rhymes with &nbsp;a car. &nbsp;I'm still using a similar mix of boring ship modules as my bread and butter. &nbsp;There are less orders, so the .01 isk game is a little less intense. &nbsp;On the flip side, people will raise prices or lower them in much larger amount, so that's fun. &nbsp;An entrepreneurial note, watch the sell orders that are &nbsp;a few isk above the buy orders. &nbsp;They can help when you want some stock, or they can be a sign to get out if the quantity is higher than you can snap up and turn around.<br /><br />I'm glad the day went well, because I was starting to get a bit weary of the Jita trade scene, and a nice day makes the whole trade enterprise more fun. &nbsp;I may have some fun charts coming, If I can be arsed to censor the data down. &nbsp;Maybe I'll post it on Day 15 as the "Half Marathon" post.
