I'd rather not have to deal with the likelihood of Facebook integration.<br /><br />Maybe Facebook is going to try and branch out into providing a real gaming platform.&nbsp; If the short history of the company is any indicator, this is another smash and grab for more users at the expense of quality user experiences.&nbsp; I do hope I am wrong, and this is the beginning of something very exciting.&nbsp; We'll have to wait and see.<br /><br />
