I flew an Onyx in combat for the first time last night. So I might as well type it up.

The corp was running around, one group out searching and scanning, the other running sites to feed our insatiable hungry for isk. The call comes out over comms:

"I've got two Dominixes in the C3 off lowsec. Running a site. Looks like they are repping each other."

Carebear fleet slams on the brakes, reships into things with pointy sticks and tackle, and we get in position on the LS&gt;C3. I am sitting in my Onyx, trying to pretend I know how to bubble. We notice an Anathema jump through into the C3, but it is a third party so we don't pay too much attention.

The Domis are being annoying, warping around and being spread out. In the time it took us to stage they finished the wave they were on. We have two cloakies in the site, manuevering for initial tackle. The our FC says "All tackle jump and warp to site". My braind someone decides that an Onyx is tackle, and I jump and warp. Then FC says "Hold cloaks". Well crap, I just entered warp.

"Ah shit, I am in warp. Sorry!"

"Goddamit, Grimm, why did you warp? I said tackle! Everyone let's go, jump and warp."

I land, bubble up, the fleet arrives, and luckily we <a href="https://zkillboard.com/kill/52359226/">break</a> <a href="https://zkillboard.com/kill/52359222/">through</a> the remote repped Domis without too much trouble. However, my early warp means there are plenty of sleepers on the field, so we scramble to get the goods and get out.

Waiting on the C3, suddenly a rogue Proteus appears! Same corp as that Anathema. We do a bit of push-me-pull-me on the whole, and then the chase is on inside the C3. Eventually we get the Proteus, but the trap is sprung.

"Four Vindicators on D-scan!"

Yeah, four Vindicators, Sabre, three Proteus, Loki, legion piling on from another hole in the C3. Looks like somebody else was also watching that pair of Domis, or saw our fleet staged in low sec. In the end we mostly moonwalked out, but a few guys got stuck. We took down two Domis and a Sabre, we lost a Legion, a Vexor and a Myrmidon.

So what did I learn?

First, don't be a dumb and think before hitting buttons. I think it is fair to say my screw-up bagged us the Domis, as the other corp was probably hoping to grab both the Domis and us, and my derp might have let us commit before the other fleet was staged. But that does not excuse derping like a derp. They could have been ready and we could all have gotten slaughtered.

Second, don't ignore third party scouts. Since we say it come in through the LS, we assumed it was just a scanner or tourist. We paid for that.
