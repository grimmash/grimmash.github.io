Results:<br /><div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://grimmash.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Day-191.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://grimmash.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Day-191.png" /></a></div>I got bored again today. &nbsp;Instead of station trading much I went out and collected a bunch of items on 5-jump buy orders. &nbsp;First, I am never doing that again. &nbsp;Not my play style. &nbsp;Second, I got to see a lot of stations I had never noticed before. &nbsp;That was fun, but not something to repeat in this context.<br /><br />I also closed out a lot of orders, hence the lack of buy orders when I ran these numbers. &nbsp;Trying to decide if I want to stay where I am or engage in more options afield. &nbsp;Remote buy orders are something I need to look into in order to get more large margin modules to take to the trade hub.<br /><br />Finally, I think I am getting close to PLEX time to keep the account going. &nbsp;I have a few more days, and I'd like to get up around 700m before trading in a large portion. &nbsp;Having a big pool of isk allows for more freedom to manipulate orders into my favor, and I don;t want to drop back down to 50m in total cash at this point.
