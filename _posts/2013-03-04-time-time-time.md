Unrelated to Eve:<br /><br />After almost a year off, I'm testing the waters in Eve again. &nbsp;Crazy how fast that year went, and everything that's happened in my life. &nbsp;Marriage, moving twice, family illness, and a hefty Minecraft addiction all put Eve in the backseat. &nbsp;Proof I suppose that everything has a season.<br /><br /><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://grimmash.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/2171651-satellite-dishes-antenna-doppler-radar-300x3001.jpg" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://grimmash.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/2171651-satellite-dishes-antenna-doppler-radar-300x3001-300x300.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td style="text-align: center;">Can't stop the signal? &nbsp;We'll see...</td></tr></tbody></table>I'm going to start writing again, but with a few caveats: &nbsp;I'll probably talk about more than just Eve on this blog. &nbsp;Due to that, I may have to revamp the format to make it multi-game appropriate. &nbsp;If anyone who is *still* linking to me cares about that, make your adjustments accordingly :).<br /><br />Back to Eve:<br /><a href="http://grimmash.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/2171651-satellite-dishes-antenna-doppler-radar-300x3001.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><br /></a><br />Just before I unsubbed, I had been working on a 30-Day market challenge. &nbsp;I actually wrote the guide, but never formatted or posted it. &nbsp;Expect to see that soon, as well as a new version. &nbsp;I am starting up my market trading again, as the isk I made last year disappeared into PLEXes and I know find myself space poor once again, and looking to set up a sizable stable of ships for a new FW endeavor.<br /><br />To those who have stumbled here over the last few months, thanks for coming! &nbsp;I can't say I'll be posting as often as I was last year, but I hope to once again add to the Eve blogging community!
