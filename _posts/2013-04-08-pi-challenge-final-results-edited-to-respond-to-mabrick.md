<i>Edit: &nbsp;Mabrick <a href="http://mabricksmumblings.blogspot.com/2013/04/you-will-sometimes-pay-price-for-their.html">responded to this post</a>, and I want to share/respond to some of his thoughts, as I may have not been clear about some things.&nbsp;</i><br /><i><br /></i><br /><ul><li><i>I made isk, 134m isk specifically. &nbsp;I did not lose any money on this. &nbsp;HS PI will MAKE YOU ISK!</i></li><li><i>In Mabrick's initial post, he gives a specific skill set. &nbsp;I DID NOT use this skill set. &nbsp;I tried to note this below, and in the previous posts, giving my skills, and revised estimates for how much might be earnable.</i></li><li><i>Even given the above, based on my experience, Kao's results, and Mabrick's own writing, I stand by my claim: Mabrick's original and revised amounts per month, and my own revised amount per month, are false given the current state of PI in High Sec.</i></li><li><i>I did wholeheartedly try to make as much as possible, and was in no way trying to sabotage Mabrick's claims. &nbsp;I only wanted to test them.</i></li><li><i>I am in no way opposed to the "passive" playstyle. &nbsp;I have an alt that only does industry, and did this challenge. &nbsp;It is my opinion that for a brand new player, however, spending the first 2 months of the game training skills that are entirely passive is not the best use of time, nor the best way to make isk. &nbsp;Each player will have their own take on that, I only tried to explain why I thought other uses of your first 2 months might be better for a new bro.</i></li></ul><i>I would like to give a HUGE thank you to Mabrick for being the impetus of this project, and for engaging in conversation on both ends of the project. &nbsp;Go read his blog, but more importantly, go buy his stuff in game!</i><br /><br />I began the 30 day PI challenge on 3/8/2013, Eve time. &nbsp;I just sold off all the excess product I had as of 02:09, 4/8/2013 Eve time. &nbsp;That's just over 1 month of in-game production time. &nbsp;I had 2 days where mis-clicks in the interface stopped production on a planet, but I also ran R0&gt;P1 production starting on 3/5/2013, so I will call it a wash. &nbsp;Here are the final results of my efforts:<br /><br /><div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://grimmash.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/PI-Final-300x2231.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="238" src="http://grimmash.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/PI-Final-300x2231-300x223.png" width="320" /></a></div>The net profit after 30 days was 134.7m isk. &nbsp;In his original challenge, Mabrick claimed that a new player, trained to the skills listed below could make 500m isk in 30 days, in High Sec:<br /><ul><li><div>Planetology to Level IV</div></li><li><div>Command Center Upgrades to Level V</div></li><li><div>Interplanetary Consolidation to Level V</div></li><li><div>Advanced Planetology to Level III</div></li></ul>I modified the challenge to shoot for 50%-75%, or 250m to 375m isk, with the following skills:<br /><br /><ul><li><div>Planetology to Level IV</div></li><li><div>Command Center Upgrades to Level IV</div></li><li><div>Interplanetary Consolidation to Level IV</div></li><li><div>Advanced Planetology to Level III</div></li></ul>At this time, unless there is information I am missing, or there is something I did fundamentally wrong, I am going to say Mabrick was considerably overestimating how much High Sec PI can produce in both cases. &nbsp;Even ignoring the costs of setup, which would not be present in subsequent months after starting a high sec PI setup, profit would still only reach roughly 175m. &nbsp;I derive that by subtracting the Planetary Construction costs from the Total Revenues. &nbsp;Taxes would still have to be paid.<br /><br />Mabrick's Original and Modified Hypotheses: False, by a long shot.<br /><br />It is important to note that I did make 134m isk. &nbsp;Based on the claims, I was just hoping for better!<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;">*****</div><br />Commentary and opinion time.<br /><br />Let's look at a different metric, return on investment, or the ROI. &nbsp;Simply put, ROI is your profit over your costs. &nbsp;In my case this is about 208m in revenue over 74m in costs. &nbsp;That gives an ROI of 2.82. &nbsp;I made 2.82 times what I spent over the course of this project. &nbsp;Let's compare that to my 30 day market challenge. &nbsp;I invested 5m isk, and ended up making 1461.8m isk. &nbsp;That's an ROI of 292.36. &nbsp;For a little more effort each day.<br /><br />Let's look at another option. &nbsp;My skill-set takes about 13 days to train, and made 134m isk in one month. &nbsp;In two months, the training time for Mabrick's skill queue, you could roughly train a given race's Frigate, Destroyer, Cruiser, and Battelcruiser, and the racial medium weapon system and support skills to 4, along with Drones 5. &nbsp;I strongly doubt that extra planet and level of CCUs in Mabrick's plan will add ~370m to the total. &nbsp;If we look at my setup and add 1 planet at the same rates, we are talking ~30m more isk. &nbsp;Given synergies of upgrading product, lets round up the monthly profit to 200m. &nbsp;How does this compare to missioning one level 4 a day?<br /><br />Throw in another 3.5 days, and you can have Salvaging 4. &nbsp;In two months you would be able to grind up to level 4 missions, and salvage them, getting 10-25m isk per mission, along with LP. 5-10 missions would get you the same net profit as my month of PI. &nbsp;In a Drake, a level 4 takes about 45 minutes per mission. Do one mission per day, with salvage, and I would wager you will make at least twice what my PI efforts made, and possibly more if you are lucky and smart about selling the salvage. &nbsp;Buy some basic rig BPOs that require no research, and you would do even better. &nbsp;Of course, that would entail extra industrial training, but not 2 months worth. &nbsp;More like a week to get to a decent point to make small rigs.<br /><br />The point of my comparisons is this: &nbsp;PI in high sec will make you some money, this is absolutely true. &nbsp;It is also boring, tedious, and less profitable than almost any other active play style. &nbsp;For a brand new character, taking 2 months to train PI skills is an utter waste of time. &nbsp;A smaller, modified schedule might do some good, and strike a balance between passive income and active income. &nbsp;If you are a new player and have access to nullsec or WH space, this may differ. &nbsp;But you need a lot of specialized equipment to survive in WH space. &nbsp;And the two months of PI training is time you won't spend getting the skills for those ships.<br /><br />I would recommend any new player to train their ship, fitting, and turret/missile skills before embarking on a long PI train. &nbsp;At the end of the day, Eve is about internet spaceships, and having fun in those. &nbsp;Most of the rewarding parts of the game were built around being in space and doing things. &nbsp;If and when you feel that you can take a break from the "core" skills, invest some time in PI. &nbsp;It will make you a bit on the side. &nbsp;But unless you are in the situation where you have access to extremely rich planets (read: not HS), 2 months of PI training is not going to get you as much as almost any other training program you could follow.
