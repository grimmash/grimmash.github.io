I'm starting a new feature: &nbsp;Forum questions, where I ask you to respond to some crazy idea I come up with! &nbsp;Without further ado, here is my question:<br /><div><br /></div><div>What if a new industrial hull was added that had a slight buff to tanking ability and more turret slots with a negative "bonus" to those turrets? &nbsp;Something like:<br /><br /><a href="http://grimmash.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/badgermk21.jpg" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://grimmash.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/badgermk21.jpg" /></a>Honey Badger<br /><br />After years of plying the space lanes, Caldari industrial interests decided to update the tried-and-sometimes-true Badger to take into account the realities of cargo transport in New Eden. &nbsp;While not intended to pose a true threat, the Honey Badger has a bit more bite than previous versions with the ability &nbsp;to mount a semblance of firepower, while at a reduced cargo capacity.<br /><br />Caldari Industrial Skill Bonus:<br /><br /><ul><li>5% bonus to shield resistance</li><li>5% bonus to cargo capacity and velocity</li></ul><br /><div>Role Bonus:<br /><br /><ul><li>-25% turret rate of fire</li></ul><div>Give it 4/6/3 layout with 4 turret slots, same general stats as the Badger Mk II.</div><div><br /></div><div>Discuss!</div></div><div><br /></div></div>
