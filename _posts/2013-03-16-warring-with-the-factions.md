A few nights ago I had my first foray into faction warfare. &nbsp;I spent a few days moving ships and assets out of Caldari space to new high sec mothball hangar in Gallente space, bought and contracted a bunch of ships to my new low sec home, and while waiting for the bulk of my supplies to arrive, I hopped into a few ships and took the not-so friendly stars of Black Rise.<br /><br />The first thing that happened was <a href="http://eve-kill.net/?a=kill_detail&amp;kll_id=16807048" target="_blank">this</a>. &nbsp;I warped around Nennamaila for a while and ended up in a small complex, I think that's what it was, and starting orbiting the structure with a timer. &nbsp;That seemed like the logical thing to do, right? &nbsp;Shortly thereafter, my new friend warped in. &nbsp;He had an Atron, I had a Incursus, I figured why not? &nbsp;Cut to a rather long chase, with me cycling between webs and reps, struggling to keep the Atron in range after my poor drone had turned to space dust. &nbsp;I'd gotten him to structure, and had a solid scram on him, but this was taking forever! &nbsp;My Gallente militia mate happend into the room at that point, and a few more shots from his Condor tipped the tide. &nbsp;Queue me saying "First PVP kill EVAR!" in local, gfs all around, and a sense of accomplishment.<br /><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://grimmash.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/eda_hask-02_explosion-300x2391.jpg" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="256" src="http://grimmash.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/eda_hask-02_explosion-300x2391-300x239.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td style="text-align: center;">"I found a target! &nbsp;Oh, never mind, <br />I'll be back once I find a new ship..."</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><br />Then we come to <a href="http://eve-kill.net/?a=kill_detail&amp;kll_id=16808695" target="_blank">this</a>. &nbsp;A pile of hostiles pop into local, but not militia war targets. &nbsp;Ok, I'll keep orbiting my button. &nbsp;Probably some people passing through, as had been going on all night. &nbsp;I see a warning in local from a militia mate, then TEST said hello. &nbsp;I get a little overwhelmed, and fail to warp out fast enough because I'm a nub with poor combat navigation skills, lose the poor Incursus (She was so damn happy after that last fight!), then lose my pod. &nbsp;Good news: &nbsp;I just created a new clone, and put in much cheaper implants. &nbsp;Bad news: I need to redefine <a href="http://eve-kill.net/?a=kill_detail&amp;kll_id=16807332" target="_blank">cheap</a>, and I learned my medical clone's home was in Caldari space. &nbsp;Good call, me. &nbsp;A ship worth 10m isk, implants worth about 46m, and my clone itself, which is now worth about 43m. &nbsp;Yeouch. &nbsp;I need to learn not to lose my pod!<br /><br />And last, I can't post, because the KM was never put up on the boards, but I lost an Algos to two Harpies because of stupid. &nbsp;I thought the Condor with me was warping in, saw the "Don't" in local, realized I had no point to keep the Harpies off me and let those sexy drones do damage, and poof. &nbsp;Got my pod out this time though! &nbsp;Most of this I realized in hindsight. &nbsp;The lesson is always make sure your fellow pilots are planning on engaging. &nbsp;After that I was out of ships and adrenaline for the night, although it seems my hero antics proceeded to escalate a small brawl that had the good fights going all around local a few minutes later. &nbsp;So I'll take that as a victory, and stop flying destroyers for a while.<br /><br />All in all, a very fun night. &nbsp;I just waiting on the rest of my ships to get in, and then MOAR FIGHTINGS!<br /><br />PS - Shoutout to Alamar Caledane, for being all friendly my first night out. &nbsp;And the title of the blog, he helpfully told me, will get me killed. &nbsp;Yep. &nbsp;That's the joke, if you didn't get it.
