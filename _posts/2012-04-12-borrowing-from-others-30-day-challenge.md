I'm blatantly stealing a project from another blogger, the <a href="http://guidetoeveonline.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">51 Day Challenge</a>. &nbsp;Beamer Grey started this but never finished it. &nbsp;I'm going to pick it up, dust it off, and run it for 30 days.<br /><br /><b>Goal:&nbsp;</b><br />Make as much money as possible on a new alt by ONLY trading.<br /><br /><b>Rules:&nbsp;</b><br /><ul><li>No leaving station</li><li>Only market transactions can be used</li><li>Start with 5 million isk as seed money</li></ul><div><b>Reporting:</b></div><div>Each day I will report the following:</div><div><ul><li><b>Starting Isk: </b>The Total Isk from the previous day</li><li><b>Cash on hand</b></li><li><b>Buy Orders Value</b></li><li><b>Sells Orders Value</b></li><li><b>Total Isk</b> = Cash + Buy Orders + Sell Orders</li><li><b>Liquid Isk</b> = Cash + Buy Orders: This seems to me to be a useful term to have to illustrate what the actually accessible isk is each day.</li></ul><div>I started last night, so the first report comes later today!</div></div>
