In my earlier wrap up of my PI challenge, I noted that I was considering running PI on all three characters on one account. &nbsp;I did this. &nbsp;Mainly because I though <a href="http://mabricksmumblings.blogspot.com/">Mabrick's </a><a href="http://mabricksmumblings.blogspot.com/2013/04/you-will-sometimes-pay-price-for-their.html">claims</a> might have a silver lining if I ran it that way. There's more posts over there, you should read them. &nbsp;He has some interesting views on Eve.<br /><br />Back to the follow up. &nbsp;As a reminder, here were the results from the first month. &nbsp;The key point is that I netted about 134m in profits.<br /><br /><div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://grimmash.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/PI-Final-300x2231.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="238" src="http://grimmash.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/PI-Final-300x2231-300x223.png" width="320" /></a></div><br />Across three characters on the same account, with 4s in Command Center Upgrades and Planetary Consolidation, I ended up netting this:<br /><br /><div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://grimmash.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/April-Final-300x2171.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="232" src="http://grimmash.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/April-Final-300x2171-300x217.png" width="320" /></a></div><br />Not quite triple the total, but I had to run 2 factory planets. &nbsp;And 334m isk ain't bad. &nbsp;A few thoughts on this.<br /><br /><ul><li>I didn't even have CCU 4 and IC 4 trained at the outset. &nbsp;That took about two weeks or so. &nbsp;So that's lost income. &nbsp;</li><li>I was also much less serious this time around, and missed more than a few updates by margins of hours or days. &nbsp;Also failed to move some ECUs when I knew I should have. &nbsp;That's also money lost.&nbsp;</li><li>Due to resource imbalances, sometimes I stockpiled, and sometimes I just hauled and sold. &nbsp;Not sure how that impacted things.</li></ul>In regards to Mabrick's original and revised estimates of 500m or 300m/month respectively, I think both are possible if you are willing to run all the characters on an account. &nbsp;With level 4 skills, 300m is more than doable, as evidenced. &nbsp;500m might be, if you train 5s, pick planets with a bit of luck and wisdom, and pick the right things to produce.<br /><br />So here it is, with the caveat that you need to use all 3 characters, in no uncertain terms:<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;">Mabrick was right.</div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;">There, the crow has been eaten. &nbsp;Tasted kind of like chicken. &nbsp;I'm happy to be wrong, in this case.</div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;">I'll keep this project running. &nbsp;I am moving my operations, as I just started up with a new Corp on my industrialist toon, and humping 22 jumps every two days is not fun. &nbsp;We'll see how the new set of systems I scouted work out. &nbsp;It was much simpler this time, partly from experience and partly from luck.</div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: center;">*****</div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;">In completely unrelated to game news, I just finished my last final in my last class in my masters program. Just have my defense to schedule and complete, and I will be officially done with higher education! &nbsp;The only way I'll pile it higher and deeper is if someone offers to pay for it next time :). &nbsp;But it's a crazy moment, I'm too tired to go out and drink, so here's to conclusions and momentous events!</div>
