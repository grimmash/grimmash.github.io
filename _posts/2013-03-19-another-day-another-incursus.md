<div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://grimmash.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/incursus1.jpeg" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://grimmash.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/incursus1.jpeg" /></a></div>I like the Incursus. &nbsp;It's a nice little ship that looks pretty and seems to hold up well in small matches. &nbsp;And I got another <a href="http://eve-kill.net/?a=kill_detail&amp;kll_id=16858329" target="_blank">kill</a> in one today. &nbsp;Nothing fancy about it. &nbsp;In fact, he got the drop on me because I was sitting in a plex, looking at three different chats and comms trying to figure out where the damn fights were. &nbsp;And then the fight was targeting me. &nbsp;We danced for a while, and as often happens, some other militia came in while we were jockeying for position. &nbsp;Much like last time, I had him in a bit of armor, he had chipped away at my shields. &nbsp;I find it terribly difficult to manage my screen, &nbsp;but I'm trying to get the spiral approach down and it seems to be working a little. &nbsp;At least based on relative shields and armor in the brief 1v1 situations I've been in. &nbsp;So that was fun. &nbsp;I'm starting to realize how janky the drone control system is though. &nbsp;Ugh. &nbsp;I have to stop forgetting to launch drones.<br /><br />After that, I tried to fleet up for a while which was a mixed bag. &nbsp;No offense to non-American english speakers, but system names and abbreviations are giving me a headache, at least for now. &nbsp;I'm over in Nennamaila most of the time, looking for fights, and the weird adjacent systems seems to be french in origin, and whatever the heck Caldari names are based on. &nbsp;And I now know what OMS means.<br /><br />But about fleets. &nbsp;I joined the rolling Gallente Militia fleet a few times today, with very little to show for it except an unfortunate Tusker who warped into a plex not realizing we had about 13 cruisers and frigs waiting. &nbsp;That stabber <a href="http://eve-kill.net/?a=kill_detail&amp;kll_id=16860363" target="_blank">didn't take long</a> to go down, and we obliged his goal of finding a way to rid himself of a hull. &nbsp;I almost didn't make it on the kill it happened so fast. &nbsp;Aside from that, I missed the few larger fights, and am starting to see the odd dance in FW fleet combat. &nbsp;No one wants to get rolled, so any time a larger fleet rounds itself up and goes out for a stroll, it seems like the skies are empty. &nbsp;Makes sense. <br /><br />I also missed out on a few fights due to poor positioning and timing. &nbsp;Such as a group of Ruptures landing on Nenn station. &nbsp;I docked up, in my solo Incursus, only to undock in time to see one of our pilots in an Archon, mopping up 30km off station and plenty of friendlies plinking away. &nbsp;I just couldn't burn out fast enough to engage.
