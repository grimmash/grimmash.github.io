Results:<br /><div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://grimmash.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Day-271.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://grimmash.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Day-271.png" /></a></div>So I moved again, woo. &nbsp;Back to Jita. &nbsp;I was in Dodixie for long enough to realize that it is hot mess at the moment. &nbsp;Although you cannot prove bots exist, I'll be damned if they haven't infested that joint. &nbsp;I sat for about fifteen minutes updating orders, and a slew of odd updates would come every single time after I updated. &nbsp;Some would be for the exact same price, .01 isk above or below me depending. &nbsp;If I have to deal with that, at least I can do it where more people are buying and selling stuff. &nbsp;So, back to Jita. &nbsp;It's rather frustrating moving tens of millions of isk back and forth and having very little to show for it.<br /><br />The nice part is that my liquid isk is up to 855 mil. &nbsp;Not bad, not too much locked into inventory. &nbsp;I will need to buy PLEX (in game) in the next day or two. &nbsp;I'll likely add that to the running total to indicate the monthly total, in the spirit of this challenge.<br /><br />I will take this moment to say this:<br /><br />I've proved the hypothesis of Beamer Grey and myself. &nbsp;You can make enough isk station trading to plex an account in less than a month. &nbsp;You can do it much more quickly than 30 days even. &nbsp;At this point I could PLEX and still have enough to fit out a few battle cruisers or one battleship. &nbsp;I've made money on my other accounts, almost totaling another PLEX, and I haven't really been playing those much lately. &nbsp;Even if you are unemployed, with a little dedication to trading, you can afford Eve. Assuming you can afford a computer and internet connection, but that kind of goes without saying.<br /><br />I'll be continuing through the last few days, and then I plan on writing up a sort of guide to what I've done. &nbsp;This will have more detail than my daily posts. &nbsp;I'll also post up ALL the items I traded in so you can see what I used. &nbsp;I don't think this is trade secret. &nbsp;After almost a month of this, there are no secrets that I found to foolproof. &nbsp;Just some solid strategies and some time spent each day keeping on top of the orders you have.
