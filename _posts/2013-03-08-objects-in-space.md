<i>Note: This is old material, sitting in my draft bin for a long period of time.&nbsp; The links are also to the old articles that got me thinking.</i><br /><div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://grimmash.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/627-300x1681.jpg" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="179" src="http://grimmash.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/627-300x1681-300x168.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><br /><br />Why should ships log off when players log off? &nbsp;This has always interested me in Eve. &nbsp;My understanding of the current mechanic is that, aside from timers, if you log off while in space, you go into a "warp stasis", where your ship is apparently in a pocket dimension that you mysteriously come back from when you log back in. &nbsp;From a technical standpoint, I can sort of understand this. &nbsp;There are already enough objects in space on the server. &nbsp;But perhaps if you log off while in space, your ship should stay where you left it?<br /><br />This would fit with the ideas behind stations and POSes. &nbsp;Stations are where you go to get out of your ship, get other ships, trade, and so on. &nbsp;Stattions are also the only almost completely safe space in Eve. &nbsp;No one can blow up your ship while it's docked. &nbsp;In space where stations do not exist, POSes fulfill this role with hangars and force fields. &nbsp;Would anyone leave a valuable ship sitting in a WH outside the POS shields?<br /><br />From a PvP perspective, this would make all sorts of logging strategies effectively worthless, unless you felt safe leaving a ship at deep safes and assuming no one would come find you. &nbsp;It would eliminate the idea of invisible campers in WH space, assuming the residents actually took the time to use combat probes. &nbsp;It would also require gate campers to actually show their presence in space instead of hiding in the warp stasis bubble.<br /><br />As for what happens to a logged out ship floating in space, there are options. &nbsp;I imagine the status of the ship would be to continue running whatever modules were active when you logged. &nbsp;So many ships would eventually cap out, then drift once recharged. &nbsp;The biggest problem I see is the problem of what happens to your velocity. &nbsp;It would cause problems to have ships just... fly forever. &nbsp;So maybe you program autopilot AI that says if a plaer is logged out for X minutes, the ship finds the nearest celestial and warps to it. &nbsp;You could even give people the option of what celestial, or station, and what distance to choose, and if docking is completed. &nbsp;You'd probably need a default of 1000km from the nearest planet if none of the player options are available to deal with station docking rights and WHs, but there could be a system.<br /><br />All of this is to say that the whole log off in space mechanic in Eve seems to be a throwback to computing limitations. &nbsp;In many ways, the log of mechanics still provide some rather big bugbears. &nbsp;Gate camps and WH squatters come to mind. &nbsp;Would it hurt to have objects in space become a little more persistent?
