It's been a few months. &nbsp;Due to family illness and unemployment after graduating from my latest round of education I completely left Eve as both an expense I could not justify and a time sink I could not engage in given my play style. &nbsp;The illness continues, but the unemployment looks to be coming to an end. &nbsp;I hope to resubscribe soon, but I'm not sure how much time I will have to play.<br /><br />On the blog front, I want to expand what I write about here. &nbsp;I want to write about more than Eve, as I have had a chance to play more casual games that one can simply walk away from when needed at a moments notice. &nbsp;I'm not sure if that means I will renamed or redesign the blog, but I do know it means this will no longer be just an Eve blog.<br /><br />My biggest regret is that without realizing it, I let most of my contacts and relationships in Eve just wither away for the last few months, so to all those who had been conversing with me and sharing their time and knowledge, sorry for that. &nbsp;Life outside internet spaceships came first, and will continue to do so.<br /><br />I hope to back in game in a month or so, and I hope to see some familiar faces soon!
