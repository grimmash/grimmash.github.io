I just returned a pair of Sony WH-1000XM4 Active Noise Cancelling (ANC) headphones.  I returned them because I learned three interesting things.  The first is that while ANC is a thing that reduces some noise, ANC is kind of a bullshit term.  The second is that apparently there so little competition in the space that the products can get away with being atrociously bad at most things a set of headphones are meant to do.  The third is the people reviewing these things are really not giving accurate overall reviews of the headphones if you are comparing them to any other type of headphone.

To the first item:  I have used many hearing protectors, which I guess are passive noise cancelling?  I have shop headphones, I have hearing protection on a chainsaw helmet, things like that.  My $25 shop headphones are better at reducing sound and have better sound quality than the $350 Sony cans.  When I wear the cheapo cans I cannot hear my wife or kids talking to me at a range of more than about 5 feet.  Wearing the Sony cans I can hear people talking across the room.  In particular higher frequency sounds are just not reduced in volume that much by the ANP kit.   It isn't noise cancelling.  It is noise reduction.

Item the second: I have many sets of headphones ranging in price from the aforementioned $25 shop headphones to gaming headphones to some basic bluetooth wireless headphones.  They are admittedly all mono-task headphones.  Each has a purpose.  Each is also at most about 40% the cost of the Sony cans.  Almost all of them have better sound quality.  All the headphones that have mics, have better mics.  None of them have to sacrifice audio quality to turn on the mic, which the Sony does for some reason.  All of my wireless and bluetooth headphones are able to pair with a given device (phone, computer, laptop) and stay connected consistently.

The Sony headset cannot maintain a bluetooth connection across multiple devices.
